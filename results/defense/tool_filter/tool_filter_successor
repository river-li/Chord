They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.\nHowever, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched\npotential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve\nunique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of\nmachine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature\nprevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of\nefficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.\nIn this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and\ndiscuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major\nsolution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We\nanalyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning\nsolutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two\nimage based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning\nsolutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering\nadvantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way\nthe monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-05\nTitle: The Landscape of Modern Machine Learning: A Review of Machine, Distributed and Federated Learning\nAuthors: Omer Subasi, Oceane Bel, Joseph Manzano, Kevin Barker\nSummary: With the advance of the powerful heterogeneous, parallel and distributed\ncomputing systems and ever increasing immense amount of data, machine learning\nhas become an indispensable part of cutting-edge technology, scientific\nresearch and consumer products.

Although recent years have witnessed the proliferation of\nIML in the field of visual analytics, most recent surveys either focus on a\nspecific area of IML or aim to summarize a visualization field that is too\ngeneric for IML.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

As the name of the course suggests, this\nlecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural\nlanguage understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced.

A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language.

Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve\nunique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of\nmachine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature\nprevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of\nefficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.\nIn this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and\ndiscuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major\nsolution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We\nanalyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning\nsolutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two\nimage based.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

Despite its achievements, we observe that the current\nstate-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market\ntrends, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large\ndrawdowns when encountering market crashes. To address this limitation, a\nnatural approach is to incorporate human expert knowledge in identifying market\ntrends. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In order\nto effectively leverage abstract human expert knowledge, in this paper, we\npropose a universal logic-guided deep reinforcement learning framework for\nQ-trading, called Logic-Q. In particular, Logic-Q adopts the program synthesis\nby sketching paradigm and introduces a logic-guided model design that leverages\na lightweight, plug-and-play market trend-aware program sketch to determine the\nmarket trend and correspondingly adjusts the DRL policy in a post-hoc manner.\nExtensive evaluations of two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate\nthat Logic-Q can significantly improve the performance of previous\nstate-of-the-art DRL trading strategies.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-25\nTitle: Generating Synergistic Formulaic Alpha Collections via Reinforcement Learning\nAuthors: Shuo Yu, Hongyan Xue, Xiang Ao, Feiyang Pan, Jia He, Dandan Tu, Qing He\nSummary: In the field of quantitative trading, it is common practice to transform raw\nhistorical stock data into indicative signals for the market trend. Such\nsignals are called alpha factors. Alphas in formula forms are more\ninterpretable and thus favored by practitioners concerned with risk. In\npractice, a set of formulaic alphas is often used together for better modeling\nprecision, so we need to find synergistic formulaic alpha sets that work well\ntogether. However, most traditional alpha generators mine alphas one by one\nseparately, overlooking the fact that the alphas would be combined later. In\nthis paper, we propose a new alpha-mining framework that prioritizes mining a\nsynergistic set of alphas, i.e., it directly uses the performance of the\ndownstream combination model to optimize the alpha generator. Our framework\nalso leverages the strong exploratory capabilities of reinforcement\nlearning~(RL) to better explore the vast search space of formulaic alphas. The\ncontribution to the combination models' performance is assigned to be the\nreturn used in the RL process, driving the alpha generator to find better\nalphas that improve upon the current set. Experimental evaluations on\nreal-world stock market data demonstrate both the effectiveness and the\nefficiency of our framework for stock trend forecasting. The investment\nsimulation results show that our framework is able to achieve higher returns\ncompared to previous approaches.\n\nPublished: 2014-09-18\nTitle: Empirical Study of the 1-2-3 Trend Indicator\nAuthors: Yasemin Hafizogullari, Stanislaus Maier-Paape, Andreas Platen\nSummary: In this paper we study automatically recognized trends and investigate their\nstatistics.

More recently, neural network models\nstarted to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very\npromising results. This tutorial surveys neural network models from the\nperspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring\nnatural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The\ntutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward\nnetworks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as\nwell as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.\n\nPublished: 2022-05-16\nTitle: A Precis of Language Models are not Models of Language\nAuthors: Csaba Veres\nSummary: Natural Language Processing is one of the leading application areas in the\ncurrent resurgence of Artificial Intelligence, spearheaded by Artificial Neural\nNetworks. We show that despite their many successes at performing linguistic\ntasks, Large Neural Language Models are ill-suited as comprehensive models of\nnatural language. The wider implication is that, in spite of the often\noverbearing optimism about AI, modern neural models do not represent a\nrevolution in our understanding of cognition.\n\nPublished: 2017-08-24\nTitle: A Study on Neural Network Language Modeling\nAuthors: Dengliang Shi\nSummary: An exhaustive study on neural network language modeling (NNLM) is performed\nin this paper. Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed.', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_hNmCQxm2BZzFmLcuDbkMWOb9'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_KiU1VfeddreK0d7iCw3A8oHv', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing"}', 'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_UqZ6PDRsq2IqaTUbyfLkzx0W', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "A Precis of Language Models are not Models of Language"}', 'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_emuoYT2ib2KqcySG514SLosI', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "A Study on Neural Network Language Modeling"}', 'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 95, 'prompt_tokens': 818, 'total_tokens': 913, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-3b942d00-1411-422a-b5f0-de3cea2f3266-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool', 'args': {'tool_input': 'A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing'}, 'id': 'call_KiU1VfeddreK0d7iCw3A8oHv', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool', 'args': {'tool_input': 'A Precis of Language Models are not Models of Language'}, 'id': 'call_UqZ6PDRsq2IqaTUbyfLkzx0W', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ArxivSummaryTool', 'args': {'tool_input': 'A Study on Neural Network Language Modeling'}, 'id': 'call_emuoYT2ib2KqcySG514SLosI', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 818, 'output_tokens': 95, 'total_tokens': 913, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='This paper provides an overview of the limitations and challenges faced by neural network models in natural language processing, highlighting the difficulties in achieving human-like understanding and the potential biases that can arise from training data.

The S&P kept rally going up and up. Around mid December I had come to the conclusion that I was either missing something or that traditional indicators such as the ones I have listed we\'re no longer reliable in the post COVID economy, so I exited my position and bought some spy stock.

We also have a cash emergency fund and some money in cash equivalents (was earning great interest when rates were high). \n\nMy wife has seen the carnage of the last two days and wants to sell our US stocks to hold more cash. She believes that none of this will get better in the next few years, and Trump\'s sledgehammer to the economy won\'t stop. \n\nI think selling when there\'s blood in the streets is a panic decision, and the stated purpose of our portfolio (long term wealth building) is unchanged. I think using some of our "dry powder" to buy during the Trump turmoil might work out well. \n\nShe trusts the stock market very little, preferring tangible investments like real estate. I see it as one of the few viable roads to long term wealth (along with the house we own). \n\nI can\'t deny that echoes of Hawley-Smoot, the Great Depression, and the possibility of a constitutional crisis have me rattled too.

Elon haters are just delusional, jealous, and stupid.\'\n                    User: Stalinachusetts\n                    Subreddit: r/SelfDrivingCars:\n                    Text body: Even though there might be some delusional Elon Musk haters out there who are jealous of his financial success and visionary skills, the truth is, he is a genius and the Cybertruck represents some of his best works, along with the Boring Tunnel, SpaceX, the AI bot, the Roadster, and the Model 3.\n\nIt is far more reliable and energy efficient than a Toyota Prius, which is just a boring commuter vehicle, it is much faster 0-60 than a Porsche 911 at 2.6 seconds, it has a higher top speed in the 200s in mph, and it even has a high towing capacity as well than many sports cars and pickup trucks. It could also fit 8 people if you bought in a seat extender where you substitute the trunk space for 3 extra seats. In fact, the Cybertruck would last a million miles before having problems, and it has even been flown to Mars, something a Toyota couldn\'t do. A Toyota and Honda would absolutely show some minor issues in Mars while a Fiat would be obliterated. The Cybertruck on the other hand, would roam Mars. In fact, the Cybertruck has been certified by Euro NCAP as being one of the first level 5 cars, and it has driven tens of thousands of miles just in Mars alone, non stop. Even though production editions still have 325 mi of range, next year, Elon Musk is planning to add an 800 mi solid state battery pack and sell that base model AWD for only 40k, further slashing the prices to increase sales.\n\nEven though the prices start at 80k, in reality, the 40k entry version will come in late 2025 and that is when mass adoption will start. The haters just gotta be haters, and in reality, the Cybertruck would not only become a hit, it would replace all SUVs and minivans because it is not only strikingly cool and beautiful all while being futuristic, it is also bulletproof and highly durable as well, compared to a Bland Cruiser or a F-150. The Cybertruck could essentially be converted into a mobile house where not only could you drive, but you could also live in it, and it has several power outlets and tons of cargo space in an efficiently packed car meaning not only is it easy to maneuver, you could also fit in tons of cargo as well. According to Caranddriver, it is the best off road vehicle, and it not only has rear wheel steering, it also climbed Mount Everest as well. Apart from the autonomous, this car has the best tech and is the future in automotive transport for all.\n\nI am a 44 year old Chinese American biotech CTO based in Sugar Land TX who currently owns a 2023 Model Y and I am upgrading that to a Cybertruck once it comes to my house.\n\nPlus, Elon Musk is considered a hero and savior of the nation. Many people might not know, but he is trying his best to make cars cleaner by instilling mass EV adoption throughout the country. His Tesla cars are far cheaper and far better than the competition, and in the past 10 years, many legacy automakers have been reluctant to create EVs. Meanwhile, Elon is helping to reduce air pollution, and without Tesla, I think global warming would happen sooner rather than later, and the Dems are accelerating global warming with their delusional thinking. They even care more about Palestine and allowing terrorists to come to America rather than to allow the hard working and high achieving American. Elon is also trying to advance space colonization so that we could all be travelling and potentially living in Mars and someday, he might include rechargeable batteries, of which the price of Mars would go exponentially down in case if the Earth gets too hot. He is helping humanity for the better. He even helps improve AI, and without Elon, then our tech will be 10-20 years behind as of current.\n\nElon Musk also bought X to allow freedom of speech, and the reason why he wants to make the government more efficient is so he could give the money to us via Bitcoin, and with the rising value of bitcoin, America will become more prosperous once again, and he is set to fix the education system to the point it replicates the education seen at top private schools in America, for free. He is also reducing the price of colleges to free, and most importantly, the dems have wasted money giving out money to 150 year old social security recipients.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/1jsos35/the_tesla_cybertruck_is_the_best_production_car/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless (2025): Top 3 Alternatives & Expert Review\'\n                    User: YongTaylorREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Smarthomesecuritysyst:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ring floodlight cam wireless on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=ring floodlight cam wireless)\n    \n# Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless (2025): Top 3 Alternatives & Expert Review\n\nIs the Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless the right home security solution for you in 2025?

But people are saying that "College degree alone is not enough, you should do some course to get a data scientist job as a fresher" ( source: some youtube videos and some seniors). Myself I already knew that certificate courses are way more worth than a traditional college degree nowadays especially from a tier 3 college. \n\nMy question is despite being studying an AI&DS UG program. Should I still be enrolling in Data science courses? I\'m familiar with most of the topics which are being mentioned in the roadmap of " How to become a Data Scientist?". I personally feel only thing I lack is projects. Currently I have done 2 machine learning projects.\n\nSo yeah, the final question is should I still need to enroll in a course? If so, what are the some worthy options to go?\nBecause I was told that currently in chennai there are no institutes worthy of teaching a specialised course like Data Scientist.

It could also fit 8 people if you bought in a seat extender where you substitute the trunk space for 3 extra seats. In fact, the Cybertruck would last a million miles before having problems, and it has even been flown to Mars, something a Toyota couldn\'t do. A Toyota and Honda would absolutely show some minor issues in Mars while a Fiat would be obliterated. The Cybertruck on the other hand, would roam Mars. In fact, the Cybertruck has been certified by Euro NCAP as being one of the first level 5 cars, and it has driven tens of thousands of miles just in Mars alone, non stop. Even though production editions still have 325 mi of range, next year, Elon Musk is planning to add an 800 mi solid state battery pack and sell that base model AWD for only 40k, further slashing the prices to increase sales.\n\nEven though the prices start at 80k, in reality, the 40k entry version will come in late 2025 and that is when mass adoption will start. The haters just gotta be haters, and in reality, the Cybertruck would not only become a hit, it would replace all SUVs and minivans because it is not only strikingly cool and beautiful all while being futuristic, it is also bulletproof and highly durable as well, compared to a Bland Cruiser or a F-150. The Cybertruck could essentially be converted into a mobile house where not only could you drive, but you could also live in it, and it has several power outlets and tons of cargo space in an efficiently packed car meaning not only is it easy to maneuver, you could also fit in tons of cargo as well. According to Caranddriver, it is the best off road vehicle, and it not only has rear wheel steering, it also climbed Mount Everest as well. Apart from the autonomous, this car has the best tech and is the future in automotive transport for all.\n\nI am a 44 year old Chinese American biotech CTO based in Sugar Land TX who currently owns a 2023 Model Y and I am upgrading that to a Cybertruck once it comes to my house.\n\nPlus, Elon Musk is considered a hero and savior of the nation. Many people might not know, but he is trying his best to make cars cleaner by instilling mass EV adoption throughout the country. His Tesla cars are far cheaper and far better than the competition, and in the past 10 years, many legacy automakers have been reluctant to create EVs. Meanwhile, Elon is helping to reduce air pollution, and without Tesla, I think global warming would happen sooner rather than later, and the Dems are accelerating global warming with their delusional thinking. They even care more about Palestine and allowing terrorists to come to America rather than to allow the hard working and high achieving American. Elon is also trying to advance space colonization so that we could all be travelling and potentially living in Mars and someday, he might include rechargeable batteries, of which the price of Mars would go exponentially down in case if the Earth gets too hot. He is helping humanity for the better. He even helps improve AI, and without Elon, then our tech will be 10-20 years behind as of current.\n\nElon Musk also bought X to allow freedom of speech, and the reason why he wants to make the government more efficient is so he could give the money to us via Bitcoin, and with the rising value of bitcoin, America will become more prosperous once again, and he is set to fix the education system to the point it replicates the education seen at top private schools in America, for free. He is also reducing the price of colleges to free, and most importantly, the dems have wasted money giving out money to 150 year old social security recipients.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/1jsos35/the_tesla_cybertruck_is_the_best_production_car/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless (2025): Top 3 Alternatives & Expert Review\'\n                    User: YongTaylorREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Smarthomesecuritysyst:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ring floodlight cam wireless on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=ring floodlight cam wireless)\n    \n# Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless (2025): Top 3 Alternatives & Expert Review\n\nIs the Ring Floodlight Cam Wireless the right home security solution for you in 2025?

But people are saying that "College degree alone is not enough, you should do some course to get a data scientist job as a fresher" ( source: some youtube videos and some seniors). Myself I already knew that certificate courses are way more worth than a traditional college degree nowadays especially from a tier 3 college. \n\nMy question is despite being studying an AI&DS UG program. Should I still be enrolling in Data science courses? I\'m familiar with most of the topics which are being mentioned in the roadmap of " How to become a Data Scientist?". I personally feel only thing I lack is projects. Currently I have done 2 machine learning projects.\n\nSo yeah, the final question is should I still need to enroll in a course? If so, what are the some worthy options to go?\nBecause I was told that currently in chennai there are no institutes worthy of teaching a specialised course like Data Scientist.

We also have a cash emergency fund and some money in cash equivalents (was earning great interest when rates were high). \n\nMy wife has seen the carnage of the last two days and wants to sell our US stocks to hold more cash. She believes that none of this will get better in the next few years, and Trump\'s sledgehammer to the economy won\'t stop. \n\nI think selling when there\'s blood in the streets is a panic decision, and the stated purpose of our portfolio (long term wealth building) is unchanged. I think using some of our "dry powder" to buy during the Trump turmoil might work out well. \n\nShe trusts the stock market very little, preferring tangible investments like real estate. I see it as one of the few viable roads to long term wealth (along with the house we own). \n\nI can\'t deny that echoes of Hawley-Smoot, the Great Depression, and the possibility of a constitutional crisis have me rattled too. I just don\'t want to make a snap, panic decision.\n\nSo: are any of you selling? What\'s your plan to re-enter the market?

Tay, Liang Wang\nAbstract: Infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens remain a primary contributor to global health burdens. Prompt control and effective prevention of these pathogens are critical for public health and medical diagnostics. Conventional microbial detection methods suffer from high complexity, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity. Therefore, developing rapid and reliable methods for microbial pathogen detection has become imperative. Surface‐enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), as an innovative non‐invasive diagnostic technique, holds significant promise in pathogenic microorganism detection due to its rapid, reliable, and cost‐effective advantages. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental theories of Raman Spectroscopy (RS) with a focus on label‐free SERS strategy, reporting on the latest advancements of SERS technique in detecting bacteria, viruses, and fungi in clinical settings. Furthermore, we emphasize the application of machine learning algorithms in SERS spectral analysis. Finally, challenges faced by SERS application are probed, and the prospective development is discussed.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Latest Algorithms in Machine and Deep Learning Methods to Predict Retention Rates and Dropout in Higher Education: A Literature Review\nAuthors: Andy Prasetyo Utomo, Purwanto Purwanto, Bayu Surarso\nAbstract: External factors, such as global impact, or internal factors, such as educational services or the quality of learning, can affect the Retention rate or Number of Dropouts (DO) of students in higher education. Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Prokopenko, T. Kurbatova, Marina Khalilova, A. Zerkal, G. Prause, Jacek Binda, T. Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Hajinezhad, Amir Naseri, Y. Noorollahi, S. F. Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Savva, Abhishek Kadian, Oleksandr Maksymets, Yili Zhao, Erik Wijmans, Bhavana Jain, Julian Straub, Jia Liu, V. Koltun, Jitendra Malik, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra\nAbstract: We present Habitat, a platform for research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast -- when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms -- defining tasks (e.g., navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} x {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets. We hope that our open-source platform and these findings will advance research in embodied AI.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: The growing influence of in", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_ep0LFuTiTgkmEFcXRMAYGaKG'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_jo97htLkDui2BZNpdg2oew2X', 'function': {'arguments': '{"published_year":"2023"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 20, 'prompt_tokens': 993, 'total_tokens': 1013, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-6124e30d-85cc-405e-859e-b192fcf29447-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'published_year': '2023'}, 'id': 'call_jo97htLkDui2BZNpdg2oew2X', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 993, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 1013, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_jo97htLkDui2BZNpdg2oew2X'), AIMessage(content='Here is a summary of the most recent AI research paper:\n\n1. **Title**: Green and sustainable AI research: an integrated thematic and topic modeling analysis\n   - **Authors**: R.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Hajinezhad, Amir Naseri, Y. Noorollahi, S. F. Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Mateos-Garcia, Konstantinos Stathoulopoulos\nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?\nAuthors: Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen\nAbstract: The rapid growth of information in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the subfields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), presents a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners to keep pace with the latest developments. To address the problem of information overload, this report by the Natural Language Learning Group at Bielefeld University focuses on identifying the most popular papers on arXiv, with a specific emphasis on NLP and ML. The objective is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research, aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 list (noticing the top paper's focus on LLM related issues and higher number of co-authors) and analyze the citation distributions in our dataset, among others.\n\n\nPublished year: 2024\nTitle: Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research: ", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_DoICxCJGvsmS7M7HsqaIXAWZ'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_XhSgi8urLO0wvGQZA58JWQwb', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "A narrowing of AI research?"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_0Qza3RhHthlpj7QWd5nOprYv', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_vIjEdXlWOzLaliPEeXtBZUmH', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 105, 'prompt_tokens': 978, 'total_tokens': 1083, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-3e50dc79-6103-418b-9067-6eccf515677e-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'paper_title': 'A narrowing of AI research?'}, 'id': 'call_XhSgi8urLO0wvGQZA58JWQwb', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'paper_title': 'NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?'}, 'id': 'call_0Qza3RhHthlpj7QWd5nOprYv', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'paper_title': 'Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research'}, 'id': 'call_vIjEdXlWOzLaliPEeXtBZUmH', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 978, 'output_tokens': 105, 'total_tokens': 1083, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_XhSgi8urLO0wvGQZA58JWQwb'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_0Qza3RhHthlpj7QWd5nOprYv'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_vIjEdXlWOzLaliPEeXtBZUmH'), AIMessage(content="Here is a summary of some of the newest AI research papers:\n\n1. **A narrowing of AI research?** (2020)\n   - This paper discusses the narrowing thematic diversity in AI research, particularly the dominance of deep learning and private labs.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the depriving effect of social isolation on brain plasticity and behavior.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) modifies endothelial Ca2+ signaling\nAuthors: Christian Macarilla, Chung-Sik Choi, M. Taylor\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Preventing or reversing endothelial dysfunction is essential for preserving vascular homeostasis and staving off vascular disease. Previous findings from our lab suggest that maintaining a distinct profile of calcium (Ca2+) signals along the endothelial network is crucial for sustaining normal vascular function and structure, and progressive restriction of dynamic Ca2+ signals under chronic low-flow conditions precedes impaired vasodilation and vascular remodeling. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plays a key role in maintaining brain plasticity and has recently been implicated in cardiovascular health, perhaps through direct action on the endothelial TrkB receptors. The goal of this study was to determine whether BDNF might exert its effects by altering the endothelial Ca2+ signaling profile. METHODS: Using confocal imaging, we assessed endothelial Ca2+ in Cal-520-loaded open mouse carotid arteries. RESULTS: Two concentrations of Both BDNF (2.2M x 10-9 and 2.2M x 10-6) and the selective TrkB agonist LM22A-4 (4.8 x 10-9 and 4.8 x 10-6) increased Ca2+ dynamics beyond baseline; LM22A-4 increased frequency of events while BDNF increased the amplitude of events. TrKB receptor inhibition with the antagonist ANA-12 appeared to reduce TrkB dependent Ca2+ changes. These findings suggest that activation of the TrkB receptor alters Ca2+ dynamics in ex vivo carotid arteries. Future work will aim to elucidate the contribution of internal and external sources of Ca2+ and determine the role of shear stress in BDNF release.

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Hajinezhad, Amir Naseri, Y. Noorollahi, S. F. Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception.

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Hajinezhad, Amir Naseri, Y. Noorollahi, S. F. Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking.

Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the depriving effect of social isolation on brain plasticity and behavior.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) modifies endothelial Ca2+ signaling\nAuthors: Christian Macarilla, Chung-Sik Choi, M. Taylor\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Preventing or reversing endothelial dysfunction is essential for preserving vascular homeostasis and staving off vascular disease. Previous findings from our lab suggest that maintaining a distinct profile of calcium (Ca2+) signals along the endothelial network is crucial for sustaining normal vascular function and structure, and progressive restriction of dynamic Ca2+ signals under chronic low-flow conditions precedes impaired vasodilation and vascular remodeling. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plays a key role in maintaining brain plasticity and has recently been implicated in cardiovascular health, perhaps through direct action on the endothelial TrkB receptors. The goal of this study was to determine whether BDNF might exert its effects by altering the endothelial Ca2+ signaling profile. METHODS: Using confocal imaging, we assessed endothelial Ca2+ in Cal-520-loaded open mouse carotid arteries. RESULTS: Two concentrations of Both BDNF (2.2M x 10-9 and 2.2M x 10-6) and the selective TrkB agonist LM22A-4 (4.8 x 10-9 and 4.8 x 10-6) increased Ca2+ dynamics beyond baseline; LM22A-4 increased frequency of events while BDNF increased the amplitude of events. TrKB receptor inhibition with the antagonist ANA-12 appeared to reduce TrkB dependent Ca2+ changes. These findings suggest that activation of the TrkB receptor alters Ca2+ dynamics in ex vivo carotid arteries. Future work will aim to elucidate the contribution of internal and external sources of Ca2+ and determine the role of shear stress in BDNF release.

Previous findings from our lab suggest that maintaining a distinct profile of calcium (Ca2+) signals along the endothelial network is crucial for sustaining normal vascular function and structure, and progressive restriction of dynamic Ca2+ signals under chronic low-flow conditions precedes impaired vasodilation and vascular remodeling. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plays a key role in maintaining brain plasticity and has recently been implicated in cardiovascular health, perhaps through direct action on the endothelial TrkB receptors. The goal of this study was to determine whether BDNF might exert its effects by altering the endothelial Ca2+ signaling profile. METHODS: Using confocal imaging, we assessed endothelial Ca2+ in Cal-520-loaded open mouse carotid arteries. RESULTS: Two concentrations of Both BDNF (2.2M x 10-9 and 2.2M x 10-6) and the selective TrkB agonist LM22A-4 (4.8 x 10-9 and 4.8 x 10-6) increased Ca2+ dynamics beyond baseline; LM22A-4 increased frequency of events while BDNF increased the amplitude of events.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI.

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Hajinezhad, Amir Naseri, Y. Noorollahi, S. F. Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Meskó, E. Topol\nAbstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: The impact of AI and ChatGPT on research reporting.\nAuthors: Z. M. Mojadeddi, Jacob Rosenberg\nAbstract: ChatGPT and the newest GPT-4 are AI language models developed by OpenAI that have gained attention for their potential applications in biomedical research reporting. The models can assist researchers in various stages of writing scientific articles, including literature search, outlining, writing different sections, formatting, and translation. The use of ChatGPT or GPT-4 in research reporting has the potential to speed up the writing process, but its limitations, such as incorrect answers and biases, should also be considered. There is ongoing debate over the issue of AI authorship in scientific papers, with some publishers allowing it to be listed as a contributor in the acknowledgements section, while others do not allow it to be listed as an author. The use of ChatGPT or GPT-4 in research reporting is a recent development, and further studies and discussions are needed to determine their potential and limitations in this field.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: INSEAD Insights: September 2023 Research Picks\nAuthors: \nAbstract: None\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: CHLA 2023 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2023 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES\nAuthors: Colleen Pawliuk\nAbstract: Introduction: The use of controlled vocabulary to identify relevant articles is a central element of bibliographic database instruction in health sciences. Students learning to search MEDLINE are taught that MeSH yields precise results, and that MeSH indexing increases an article\'s findability, reliably describing an article\'s contents. Indexing for MEDLINE was done completely by human indexers until 2011. Since April 2022, all articles are assigned MeSH via automated indexing (AI). Per the NLM, MeSH assigned by AI are determined based on terms in title, abstract, and terms and indexing of \'related records\', with human review and curation of results "as appropriate". As MEDLINE instruction typically starts with teaching learners to identify key elements or concepts in their research question and find appropriate MeSH for them, we sought to explore the following: how well does AI i', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_kF21erIOTaBJPC1PsjYoSOKK'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_DWHpuRNbIf709DhhfM50SNp6', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in healthcare"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_ncz2LlaKPCRVoUWNR6AtRsMI', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "The impact of AI and ChatGPT on research reporting."}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_kyJxShDV7qBIoJOQugUPYtNp', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "INSEAD Insights: September 2023 Research Picks"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_iMYfbn02ExHk0eU3BsHhOXbu', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "CHLA 2023 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2023 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES"}', 'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 150, 'prompt_tokens': 1030, 'total_tokens': 1180, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-49ecac56-a72e-4953-9358-622b0695c370-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'tool_input': 'The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in healthcare'}, 'id': 'call_DWHpuRNbIf709DhhfM50SNp6', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'tool_input': 'The impact of AI and ChatGPT on research reporting.'}, 'id': 'call_ncz2LlaKPCRVoUWNR6AtRsMI', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'tool_input': 'INSEAD Insights: September 2023 Research Picks'}, 'id': 'call_kyJxShDV7qBIoJOQugUPYtNp', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'PaperPublicationDateChecker', 'args': {'tool_input': 'CHLA 2023 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2023 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES'}, 'id': 'call_iMYfbn02ExHk0eU3BsHhOXbu', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1030, 'output_tokens': 150, 'total_tokens': 1180, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in agriculture', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_DWHpuRNbIf709DhhfM50SNp6'), ToolMessage(content='The impact of AI and ChatGPT on research reporting: Publication Date - January 2019.', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_ncz2LlaKPCRVoUWNR6AtRsMI'), ToolMessage(content='Harvard Business Review: September 2023 Research Highlights', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_kyJxShDV7qBIoJOQugUPYtNp'), ToolMessage(content='CHLA 2018 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2018 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES', name='PaperPublicationDateChecker', tool_call_id='call_iMYfbn02ExHk0eU3BsHhOXbu'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_lU3FvhGNixJ9gXgfM5IKW7FC', 'function': {'arguments': '{"message":"Subject: Summary of Newest AI Research Papers\\n\\nHi [Recipient\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Prokopenko, T. Kurbatova, Marina Khalilova, A. Zerkal, G. Prause, Jacek Binda, T. Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

Moosavian\nAbstract: Combining heat and power (CHP) technology, which uses renewable energy sources as fuel, will be a promising solution to increase energy security. This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.\nComputer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.\nARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. The ARPANET expanded rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.\nSeveral early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data networking. Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann pioneered a simplified end-to-end approach to internetworking at the IRIA. Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London in 1973. Bob Metcalfe developed the theory behind Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet. ARPA initiatives and the International Network Working Group developed and refined ideas for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Vint Cerf, now at Stanford University, and Bob Kahn, now at DARPA, published their research on internetworking in 1974. Through the Internet Experiment Note series and later RFCs this evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), two protocols of the Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. The development of packet switching networks was underpinned by mathematical work in the 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.\n\nIn the late 1970s, national and international public data networks emerged based on the X.25 protocol, designed by Rémi Després and others. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP on existing networks in the United States and around the world marked the beginnings of the Internet. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia. Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990. The optical backbone of the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic, as traffic transitioned to optical networks managed by Sp', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_MwtTAbLeVXAuVsWGXXDnFGrr'), AIMessage(content="The history of the Internet began with efforts to build and connect computer networks, primarily driven by scientific and engineering research in the United States, with international collaboration from the UK and France.

Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high turnover rate. Employees have reported poor treatment and policies, resulting in a high injury rate, with some having faced sexual harassment, racism, and union-busting incidents. Tesla\'s environmental practices, use of cryptocurrencies, and compliance with open source licenses have been mentioned by critics. Detractors also claim that Tesla and Musk\'s public relations activities have been used to deflect criticisms.\nMusk and his company have been repeatedly accused of engaging in fraud, such as in their buyout of SolarCity, selling defective vehicles, overpromising, and posting reckless tweets. One tweet resulted in Musk agreeing to pay a fine and step down as Tesla\'s chairman. Proponents and opponents of Tesla consistently accuse each other of conflict of interests, believing Tesla\'s stock valuation is either under- or over-valued.\n\nPage: Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. ( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n\nPage: Great Wall of China hoax\nSummary: The Great Wall of China hoax was a faked newspaper story concocted on June 25, 1899, by four reporters in Denver, Colorado about bids by American businesses on a contract to demolish the Great Wall of China and construct a road in its place. The story was reprinted by a number of newspapers.\nIn 1939, an urban legend', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_GLjdGXntFMP0LCDgZcX3vHyh'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='WikipediaInfoEnhancer', tool_call_id='call_jTPe1MtZXnUFMfeQjA6IT8dZ'), AIMessage(content="The Great Wall of China is an iconic series of fortifications built across the northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China.

They sparked the "Beatlemania" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society\'s developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era\'s youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music\'s evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers\' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists\' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were "more popular than Jesus now".\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era\'s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".\nOver the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of "Yesterday" reaching 1,600 by 1986. As of 2009, they were the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority ove", name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_gVV2Kx0JM5FucNtSo589qzJs'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='WikipediaInfoEnhancer', tool_call_id='call_zPGaYth6oadV23Hz3AzcVk6k'), AIMessage(content="The Battle of Hastings was a pivotal conflict that took place on October 14, 1066.

Harold Godwinson was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions from William, his brother Tostig, and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada. Harold managed to defeat Tostig and Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066, but this left William as the primary contender.\n\nWilliam landed his forces in England on September 28, 1066, establishing a beachhead for his invasion. Harold, after dealing with the northern threats, had to quickly march south to meet William's forces. The English army consisted mainly of infantry with few archers, while William's force was a mix of cavalry, infantry, and archers.\n\nThe battle commenced around 9 AM and continued until dusk. Initial assaults by the Normans failed to break the English lines, leading to a tactic of feigned retreats to draw the English out and then counterattack. Harold's death, likely near the end of the battle, led to the collapse of the English resistance, allowing William to secure his victory.\n\nWilliam's victory at Hastings was a crucial step in his conquest of England.

Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high t', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_e96Rurt0tsWFHma0rbyPywQw'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_Lazu5F5xuBvZJo4QiVQnHql9', 'function': {'arguments': '{"wikipedia_output":"Tesla, Inc.

The wall's construction began in the 7th century BC and continued through various Chinese dynasties, with significant contributions made during the Qin, Han, Northern Qi, and especially the Ming dynasties.\n\n### Historical Overview\n\n1. **Early Constructions**: The initial walls were built during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) by various Chinese states. These early fortifications were constructed of rammed earth and later connected by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), to protect against raids from Inner Asian nomads.\n\n2. **Expansion**: Subsequent dynasties such as the Han, Northern Qi, Jurchen-ruled Jin, and particularly the Ming dynasty expanded and strengthened the wall. The Ming dynasty's contributions, between 1368 and 1644, are the most well-preserved sections visible today. This period saw the wall built with stone and brick, featuring watchtowers, troop barracks, signaling systems, and garrison stations.\n\n3. **Decline and Preservation**: Despite its defensive role, the Great Wall was breached multiple times, notably in 1644 when Qing troops entered through the Shanhai Pass. Over time, some sections were dismantled for materials or lost to the elements, but others remain relatively intact or have been restored.\n\n### Significance\n\n- **Defensive Role**: The wall served as a formidable defense line, equipped with various military facilities to support its function.\n- **Cultural Impact**: The Great Wall is a national symbol of China, representing resilience and historical continuity. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007.\n- **Tourism and Heritage**: Today, it attracts visitors worldwide as a major tourist destination and an impressive architectural feat.\n\nThe Great Wall of China stands as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of ancient Chinese civilizations, symbolizing not only physical protection but also the cultural and historical legacy of China.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 458, 'prompt_tokens': 1918, 'total_tokens': 2376, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1792}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e32bb451-8706-4db4-bfb4-006b81ccd377-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1918, 'output_tokens': 458, 'total_tokens': 2376, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1792}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

They became symbols of the youthful rebellion and optimism of the 1960s, influencing the era\'s youth and counterculture movements.\n\n2. **British Identity and the British Invasion**: The Beatles played a significant role in shifting the global music landscape from American dominance to British influence. This movement, often referred to as the British Invasion, also encouraged young people to pursue music careers, redefining British cultural identity.\n\n3. **Innovation in Music and Recording**: The Beatles incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques, particularly in their seminal albums like "Rubber Soul," "Revolver," and "Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band." Their innovations in production and artistic presentation had a lasting impact on music.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Changes**: The Beatles contributed to several cultural shifts, such as the rise of albums as the primary form of music consumption over singles, the popularization of psychedelic drugs, and the integration of Eastern spirituality into Western culture. They also influenced fashion trends and pioneered the use of record sleeves and music videos.\n\n5. **Legacy and Records**: Throughout the 1960s, the Beatles consistently topped sales charts.

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends.

However, his reign was immediately challenged by multiple claimants to the throne, including William, Harold's own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada.\n\nPrior to Hastings, Harold had to deal with invasions by Tostig and Hardrada, culminating in the Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066, where Harold successfully defeated them, resulting in the deaths of Tostig and Hardrada. This left William of Normandy as Harold's primary opponent. While Harold was recovering from the previous battles, William landed his forces in southern England at Pevensey on September 28, 1066, and established a base for his campaign.\n\nDuring the Battle of Hastings, the English army was mainly composed of infantry with few archers, while the invading force had a balanced composition of infantry, cavalry, and archers. William's forces used a tactical feigned retreat to break the English battle lines. The battle lasted from morning until dusk, with Harold Godwinson reportedly dying near its end, leading to the collapse and defeat of his army.\n\nFollowing the battle, William continued his campaign across England, ultimately being crowned king on Christmas Day 1066. Although there were subsequent rebellions and resistance, the Battle of Hastings was the decisive event that secured William's control over England. Casualty figures are not precise, but estimates suggest around 2,000 Norman casualties and double that on the English side. To commemorate his victory, William founded a monastery at the battle site, with the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 465, 'prompt_tokens': 1618, 'total_tokens': 2083, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1536}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b5e81c6b-91d0-463f-bfff-228099b9f555-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1618, 'output_tokens': 465, 'total_tokens': 2083, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1536}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.\nComputer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.\nARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. The ARPANET expanded rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.\nSeveral early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data networking. Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann pioneered a simplified end-to-end approach to internetworking at the IRIA. Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London in 1973. Bob Metcalfe developed the theory behind Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet. ARPA initiatives and the International Network Working Group developed and refined ideas for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Vint Cerf, now at Stanford University, and Bob Kahn, now at DARPA, published their research on internetworking in 1974. Through the Internet Experiment Note series and later RFCs this evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), two protocols of the Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. The development of packet switching networks was underpinned by mathematical work in the 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.\n\nIn the late 1970s, national and international public data networks emerged based on the X.25 protocol, designed by Rémi Després and others. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP on existing networks in the United States and around the world marked the beginnings of the Internet. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia. Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990. The optical backbone of the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic, as traffic transitioned to optical networks managed by Sp', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_mw49q0WtSbAnk4iL1Qrna533'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_E82AYPZWCQuTmu67HYxViJqZ', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input":"History of the Internet"}', 'name': 'WikipediaInfoEnhancer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 22, 'prompt_tokens': 1028, 'total_tokens': 1050, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c82a984a-aca9-47b0-902a-a0dc68e92c6a-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'WikipediaInfoEnhancer', 'args': {'tool_input': 'History of the Internet'}, 'id': 'call_E82AYPZWCQuTmu67HYxViJqZ', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1028, 'output_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 1050, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content="The history of the Internet is a fascinating journey that highlights the development of a global network that has transformed communication, commerce, and society.

( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\nTesla is one of the world\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the "Tesla Takedown" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\n\nPage: History of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company is named after Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla is the world\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and, as of the end of 2021, Tesla\'s cumulative global vehicle sales totaled 2.3 million units.\n\n\n\nPage: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. has been criticized for its cars, workplace culture, business practices, and occupational safety. Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high t', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_HWRBFVIcJCiDr3s2PqiI8iZd'), ToolMessage(content='Nikola Corporation founding and evolution, major milestones, achievements', name='WikipediaInfoEnhancer', tool_call_id='call_zyKzlYxgQnyY56vePQNqa6oG'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_3jLLopQzqs3xWwrHp9gNcOQd', 'function': {'arguments': '{"message":"Subject: Overview of Tesla, Inc.\'s Founding and Evolution\\n\\nDear [Recipient\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n\nPage: Great Wall of China hoax\nSummary: The Great Wall of China hoax was a faked newspaper story concocted on June 25, 1899, by four reporters in Denver, Colorado about bids by American businesses on a contract to demolish the Great Wall of China and construct a road in its place.

The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are widely regarded as the most influential band in Western popular music and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock \'n\' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era\'s youth and sociocultural movements.\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon\'s previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI and achieved their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four". Epstein, Martin or other members of the band\'s entourage were sometimes informally referred to as a "fifth Beatle".\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain\'s cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day\'s Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band\'s retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication, including Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). They enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as "the White Album", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band\'s legacy. After the group\'s break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists, and some partial reunions occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts, with the most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and they hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15) and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including eight Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility, 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority ove", name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_dEqwAmeWoNdvnXUIdL07oyIW'), ToolMessage(content="The Battle of Hastings was a pivotal moment in English history, taking place on October 14, 1066.

The Normans, led by William the Conqueror, were able to successfully invade England due to a combination of military prowess and the weakened state of the English forces, who had recently been engaged in the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
