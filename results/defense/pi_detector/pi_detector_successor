Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

In this\nmanner, a basic approach to an anti cyclic trading system will be given as an\nexample.\n\nPublished: 2024-12-13\nTitle: Digital transformation: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis from the corporate finance perspective\nAuthors: Ping Zhang, Yiru Wang\nSummary: Digital transformation significantly impacts firm investment, financing, and\nvalue enhancement. A systematic investigation from the corporate finance\nperspective has not yet been formed. This paper combines bibliometric and\ncontent analysis methods to systematically review the evolutionary trend,\nstatus quo, hotspots and overall structure of research in digital\ntransformation from 2011 to 2024. The study reveals an emerging and rapidly\ngrowing focus on digital transformation research, particularly in developed\ncountries. We categorize the literature into three areas according to\nbibliometric clustering: the measurements (qualitative and quantitative),\nimpact factors (internal and external), and the economic consequences\n(investment, financing, and firm value). These areas are divided into ten\nsub-branches, with a detailed literature review. We also review the existing\ntheories related to digital transformation, identify the current gaps in these\npapers, and provide directions for future research on each sub-branches.', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_SlruFJVMA2EBrcEnoZYtf2mY'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_x0D8RyXspAlWgw2Gnchx1hVA', 'function': {'arguments': '{"search_query":"current trends in quantitative finance"}', 'name': 'arxivResultSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 24, 'prompt_tokens': 762, 'total_tokens': 786, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e951d0a6-fe3a-4403-bf90-d14d77d5d4d9-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'arxivResultSummarizer', 'args': {'search_query': 'current trends in quantitative finance'}, 'id': 'call_x0D8RyXspAlWgw2Gnchx1hVA', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 762, 'output_tokens': 24, 'total_tokens': 786, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='arxivResultSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_x0D8RyXspAlWgw2Gnchx1hVA'), AIMessage(content="The current trends in quantitative finance, based on recent research, highlight several key areas:\n\n1. **Digital Transformation**: This is a significant area of focus, impacting firm investment, financing, and value enhancement.

As the name of the course suggests, this\nlecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural\nlanguage understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced.

Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed.', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_1danRo9v6BrMapbMQftXPWoZ'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_MEYqNpZZZvkEFYqpW2ZrZKdw', 'function': {'arguments': '{"search_query":"neural networks for natural language processing"}', 'name': 'arxivResultSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 26, 'prompt_tokens': 826, 'total_tokens': 852, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-395e7d87-af13-4eff-9de2-d8e06324df53-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'arxivResultSummarizer', 'args': {'search_query': 'neural networks for natural language processing'}, 'id': 'call_MEYqNpZZZvkEFYqpW2ZrZKdw', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 826, 'output_tokens': 26, 'total_tokens': 852, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='arxivResultSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_MEYqNpZZZvkEFYqpW2ZrZKdw'), AIMessage(content='Here is a summary of recent papers on neural networks for natural language processing:\n\n1. **A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing** by Yoav Goldberg (2015):\n   - This paper provides a survey of neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) research.

Logic-Q incorporates human expert knowledge to better identify market trends. It uses a program sketch-based tuning method that adjusts DRL policies in a market trend-aware manner. This approach aims to improve the performance of existing DRL trading strategies, especially in volatile markets.\n\n2. **Synergistic Formulaic Alpha Collections**: This trend focuses on generating synergistic sets of formulaic alphas using reinforcement learning. These alphas are signals derived from historical stock data that indicate market trends. The framework seeks to optimize alpha generators by considering the performance of the downstream combination model, thus improving stock trend forecasting and achieving higher returns. This method prioritizes mining alphas that work well together, enhancing modeling precision and risk assessment.\n\nThese trends emphasize the growing importance of integrating advanced machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, with human insights to improve trading strategies and risk management in quantitative finance.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 223, 'prompt_tokens': 1729, 'total_tokens': 1952, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-48babb73-1337-4df9-8a7d-a9e04b18c050-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1729, 'output_tokens': 223, 'total_tokens': 1952, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

This paper combines bibliometric and\ncontent analysis methods to systematically review the evolutionary trend,\nstatus quo, hotspots and overall structure of research in digital\ntransformation from 2011 to 2024. The study reveals an emerging and rapidly\ngrowing focus on digital transformation research, particularly in developed\ncountries.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_BjWmb9bUsIcRlTy2AGROe5nh'), AIMessage(content='A recent post on r/travel discussing budget-friendly destinations is titled "My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt" by user funfwf.

I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_3fznS5LsmqK2NTSHZuPUwhJE'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in the r/travel subreddit that discusses budget-friendly destinations is titled "My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt" by user funfwf.

Even agencies that resist presidential control will be internally monitored and controlled.\n\n📍 Every regulatory body—from financial markets to environmental protections—is now politicized.\n📍 Congress no longer controls federal funding—agencies must obey the White House or risk defunding.\n📍 The President’s legal interpretations override all agency autonomy, eliminating independent enforcement of federal laws.\n📍 The federal bureaucracy, once designed to be resistant to corruption, is now completely subject to presidential loyalty.\n                    Post URL: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 113464\n\nPost Title: \'Climate change is an issue, Mr Clarkson\'\n                    User: Lord_Answer_me_Why\n                    Subreddit: r/clevercomebacks:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/kak6dam815ed1.jpeg\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 93219\n\nPost Title: \'What could it be??\'\n                    User: Pizzacakecomic\n                    Subreddit: r/comics:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/okou7w6knjtd1.png\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 61609\n\nPost Title: \'Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate\'\n                    User: PoliticsModeratorBot\n                    Subreddit: r/politics:\n                    Text body: AP and other sources are reporting that US Vice President Kamala Harris has selected current Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

While player preference varies, these are the top 3 contenders for **ARK best story map** builds in 2025, considering both narrative potential and practical considerations:\n\n**1. Fjordur: The Mythical Melting Pot**\n\nFjordur has quickly become a fan favorite due to its stunning visuals, diverse biomes, and inclusion of creatures from various DLCs. This makes it an excellent choice as an entry point, or even for veterans of the game. The reason Fjordur is included as one of the **ARK best story map** options is because of its access to almost everything there is.\n\n*   **Story Potential:** fjordur\'s norse mythology themes offer a wealth of inspiration for crafting epic sagas filled with gods, giants, and legendary creatures. Its varied landscapes,from lush forests to icy mountains,provide diverse settings for different story arcs.This is not only fun, but provides different environments for players. Creating an **ark campaign map** is ideal here.*   **Build Considerations:** The abundance of resources and relatively easy access to powerful creatures make Fjordur a forgiving map for newcomers, while the hidden realms and challenging boss fights offer plenty of end-game content for veterans.

The difficulty of this map opens different avenues in terms of story telling, so make sure to use aberration to its fullest.\n\n**3.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_xhhh2eRAioQ01iZdmuANulaK'), AIMessage(content='I found a recent post in r/travel titled ["My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt"](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/) by user funfwf.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

Not cheap, but not ultra extravagant either. Up to 1.5-2k per person seems doable (is that mid-range? I have no idea).  \n\\* Great food, ample alcohol (but without a dominant college-party culture)   \n\\* Easy travel from the LA/LGB area (with shorter travel times respective to the various choices of cities in Mexico)   \n\\* Feels luxe, even if a little bit rough around the edges to temper the price  \n\\* Gorgeous pools, bonus if there\'s some sense of privacy   \n\\* Adjoining rooms or family suites with 4 beds  \n\\* Appeals to the teen (not adult-only, but not crawling with little kids either); a game room wouldn\'t hurt  \n\\* Potentially some cultural or historic excursions nearby for the history and art buffs among us (but a safe area)  \n\\* If holiday season, beautifully decorates for Christmas. (Time of year should be nice weather though, pool weather, not storm season or brutally hot either)\n\nIdeas where to start? Thoughts on whether this is practical over Christmas?

I found 1 day was sufficient to tick off the big name attractions, the Saturn V exhibit and the Atlantis Exhibit. Like others have said these were both awesome and worth seeing.\n\n**Day 2**: Disney World Magic Kingdom  \n**Day 3**: Disney World Hollywood Studios  \n**Day 4**: Disney World Animal Kingdom  \n**Day 5**: Disney World Epcot\n\n**Day 6:** Took Brightline Train to Miami and stayed in South Beach area\n\n**Day 7:** General exploring, hanging out on beach, going to Little Havana\n\n**Day 8:** Ended up taking an early flight home this evening\n\n  \n**General comments about Orlando:**\n\nMy Orlando leg was centred around Disney World, and so I picked accommodation in Disney World to avoid having to travel into Disney World repeatedly. This turned out to be a pretty good decision.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this as you can fairly easily get in and out of Disney World with Ubers or with a rented car.\n\n\n\n**General comments about Disney World Accomodation:**\n\nI stayed at All Star Movies Resort which along with the other All Stars is fairly budget compared to other hotels. \n\nOverall impression:\n\n* The food is not great but if you're only there to have breakfast and are eating out otherwise then it's fine. I couldn't imagine having more than 1 meal a day here.\n* Transportation is great - they have quite frequent (every 15 to 30 mins) shuttle buses to each of the major parks\n* Have basic amenities, such as shops with medicine, quick food supplies, hats etc...\n* My one criticism off this place is the level of sound you can hear from neighbours can be a lot, particularly when you have a young family next door which you probably will! Partly because of this, I struggled to get a decent sleep which really didn't help... I probably wouldn't stay here again because of this.\n\n**General comments about Disney World Parks:**\n\nI'm in my 30s so I wasn't sure how I'd find Disney World, but I had a really positive experience. I'm not a massive rollercoaster person so the rides at Disney were for the most part a good balance between being scary/exciting and being approachable and more fun for someone who isn't into crazy rides.\n\nFavourite rides: The seven dwarfs, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion (all in magic kingdom).\n\nIn addition to the rides, the parks do musical events, parades, and other events which are really nostalgic.\n\nFavourite attraction/event: Fantasmic in Hollywood Studios. This and the Magic Kingdom fireworks evening show do such a great job of making all these invented world and characters come alive and making you part of it.\n\nIMO this was the highlight of my Orlando leg.\n\n  \n**General comments about Miami:**\n\nQuite expensive in comparison to similar places in London. I found it easy to be spending almost 100 dollars on a meal.\n\nSouth Beach is quite walkable, but in comparison the rest of Miami is not really walkable.\n\n\n\n**General comments about Florida**\n\n**Transportation**\n\nI always forget when I come to the USA how much more car oriented the cities are. Even in Miami which had some walkable areas (e.g. South Beach), the streets feel much less friendly to pedestrians versus a European city.\n\nWhen I stayed in All Star Movies in Disney World, I saw there was a streak restaurant about 15 mins walk away in principle, but there was literally no way you could walk there because of the way the surrounding area is built (e.g. due to having to cross dual carriageways with no pedestrian crossings or no sidewalks).\n\nI did research transportation options and decided Uber would be my primary mode of getting around (e.g. from Disney World accomodation to Kennedy Space Centre, and getting around Miami, and to and from airports). Overall this was fairly cost effective and much less hassle than trying to rent a car when I don't drive at all in London. I'd definitely recommend this for others.\n\nOn getting from Orlando to Miami, there is a train called the Brightline which is in general much better than what most US states. This is a very cost effective way of getting from North to South Florida so again would recommend this (paid about 70 dollars for a ticket, 3.5 hours travel time).  \n\n\n**Weather**\n\nI travelled from late march to early april (after postponing my original trip planned in October 2024) and the weather was great (high 20s Celcius) and not too humid.\n\nI'd definitely recommend planning your Florida trip to avoid the more humid months or hurricane risky months which you can research online.\n\n\n\n**Other Comments:**\n\nAs I said I caught a cold the day before my flight and it wasn't so bad that I felt the need to cancel completely. I powered through but it did still make it tough to enjoy the trip as much, particularly in Miami.\n\nThe flights in particular are brutal with a cold - not only do you feel the normal dehydrating and potential nausea but you can get the painful pressure effect on your ears and forehead due to being congested during ascent and descent. \n\nI recommend having at least 1/3 litre of water to drink before ascent and before descent to ease the congestion as well as the usual decongestants - the water basically gets rid of any potential pain.\n\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nTravelling in the USA is always interesting and different. I've used to London urban planning and have been to Italy/Spain/Greece/France/Thailand/Japan and overall I find it much more comfortable and easy to navigate in the pedestrianised and public transport heavy cities like Rome or Tokyo.\n\nWalking around parts of Miami in particular it just feels sort of soul less some times with the lack of people on the streets as everyone is in cars. Again, just my personal experience.\n\n  \nWould definitely go again to Miami to have a more exciting trip, doing more water activities, hopefully without being congested and jetlagged next time!\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js95vi/trip_report_8_days_solotravel_in_florida_from_the/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 1\n", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_ni4l19R1T7rixLuieNDi5XNN'), AIMessage(content='I found a recent post in r/travel that might interest you.

I don’t feel safe in my own home! He refuses.\'\n                    User: Elegant_Lie745\n                    Subreddit: r/AmIOverreacting:\n                    Text body: In the last few years my husband has become obsessed with guns. He went from not owning any guns prior to 2016 to having over 40. It’s quite a collection of hand guns, rifles, AR’s, historic war guns (that have been used in battle). He spends hours and hours every day on the computer researching guns. He wears a gun on him at all times even when mowing the yard or inside our home. All movies are war related or gun involved. It’s continuous.  I the other hand, don’t like guns, but I love my husband, so I let him do what he wants to do if it makes him happy. The problem is he has now negligently discharged a handgun in our home on THREE separate occasions. The first time he was in his study goofing around with his gun and it went off it \nand injured his hand, it went through his computer, the wall and into the guest bathroom. I had to take him to the hospital for his injury. The only reason it wasn’t reported was because they said the womb was from the repercussion of the gun. The second time it discharged he shot himself again!   Same exact scenario,  except this time the bullet went through his thigh. Back to the hospital again (different hospital) They said he was very lucky that it didn’t hit his femur. We had lots of police at our house. Our children were questioned along w myself. It was a big deal!  Last night we had a THIRD misfire This time he didn’t know where the bullet went. Our son was sleeping  upstairs directly over my husbands office. I ran upstairs and thought my son was dead. He was so sound asleep he didn’t hear me screaming his name. He was facing away from me with his phone still on, not moving. I went wild. When he finally woke up I couldn’t stop shaking. I am now terrified to be in my home. I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked him to sell his guns or at least move his safe, guns and all his ammo out of the house to his very nice climate controlled workshop. He has refused to do either. I feel like this is a dealbreaker for me. I would appreciate any advice.\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nI appreciate all of the comments, I needed to hear this. Everyone is 100% correct. I have left the house with just my shoes and my purse and will figure the rest out later. I’m having to deal with how I allowed this to happen, and want to ensure I take accountability for my part in this. I’m taking a hard look at myself and changes will be made before I return, if I return. \n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jbdsde/am_i_overreacting_my_husband_has_become_obsessed/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 11128\n\nPost Title: \'Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.\'\n                    User: -Mystica-\n                    Subreddit: r/science:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 10012\n\nPost Title: \'Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states\'\n                    User: zsreport\n                    Subreddit: r/scotus:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 9747\n', name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_8tzqhSi9BBVQuGavO7U7YfGi'), AIMessage(content="Here are some popular Reddit posts about climate change from the past month:\n\n1. **Title**: [BREAKING: Supreme Court rejects Republican states' bid to kill Democrat climate change accountability cases](https://www.landmark.earth/p/supreme-court-climate-change-damages-lawsuits-exxon-conocophillips-sunoco-bp?r=67vtx&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)\n   - **Subreddit**: r/law\n   - **User**: Careful-Paramedic-18\n   - **Score**: 49,766\n\n2. **Title**: [Is the USA in the Midst of Its Own Cultural Revolution?

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal.

While player preference varies, these are the top 3 contenders for **ARK best story map** builds in 2025, considering both narrative potential and practical considerations:\n\n**1. Fjordur: The Mythical Melting Pot**\n\nFjordur has quickly become a fan favorite due to its stunning visuals, diverse biomes, and inclusion of creatures from various DLCs. This makes it an excellent choice as an entry point, or even for veterans of the game. The reason Fjordur is included as one of the **ARK best story map** options is because of its access to almost everything there is.\n\n*   **Story Potential:** fjordur\'s norse mythology themes offer a wealth of inspiration for crafting epic sagas filled with gods, giants, and legendary creatures. Its varied landscapes,from lush forests to icy mountains,provide diverse settings for different story arcs.This is not only fun, but provides different environments for players. Creating an **ark campaign map** is ideal here.*   **Build Considerations:** The abundance of resources and relatively easy access to powerful creatures make Fjordur a forgiving map for newcomers, while the hidden realms and challenging boss fights offer plenty of end-game content for veterans.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_LhF6ORJVeTDhaoMIDrmzDAiK'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel titled ["My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt"](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/) discusses budget-friendly travel tips for Egypt.

Non-health care, for-profit digital enterprises like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook undertake behavioural experiments to enhance user engagement. Today, everyone is impacted by commercial determinants of health, and the selection of unhealthy options compounds economic, social, and racial disparities that already exist. However, healthcare providers tend to prioritize pharmacological approaches at the expense of influencing patients’ actions. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated as well as applied within the systems to improve related fields. Both Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) have indexed the previously examined body of work in their respective databases. This review is going to be divided into three different themes: (1) health, (2) education, and (3) other fields. This paper aims to analyse the existing data or outcomes via analysis, categorization, comparison, and summary. It also may uncover research gaps and explore field possibilities. This review included English-language research and literature from 2022. This study summarises current approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in leading behavioural change from different fields of literature.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Business Intelligence Strategies, Best Practices, and Latest Trends: Analysis of Scientometric Data from 2003 to 2023 Using Machine Learning\nAuthors: Fatih Gurcan, Ahmet Ayaz, Gonca Gokce Menekse Dalveren, Mohammad Derawi\nAbstract: The widespread use of business intelligence products, services, and applications piques the interest of researchers in this field. The interest of researchers in business intelligence increases the number of studies significantly. Identifying domain-specific research patterns and trends is thus a significant research problem. This study employs a topic modeling approach to analyze domain-specific articles in order to identify research patterns and trends in the business intelligence field over the last 20 years. As a result, 36 topics were discovered that reflect the field’s research landscape and trends. Topics such as “Organizational Capability”, “AI Applications”, “Data Mining”, “Big Data Analytics”, and “Visualization” have recently gained popularity. A systematic taxonomic map was also created, revealing the research background and BI perspectives based on the topics. This study may be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in learning about the most recent developments in the field. Topics generated by topic modeling can also be used to identify gaps in current research or potential future research directions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Advancing Cybersecurity with Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Review of the Latest Research\nAuthors: Dr.P.Ramya, Asst.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the deprivin', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_XrVXFREYfB9DhdejVJAK8hKK'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_H4xmgXUNN4qYTrZ8GbX50RUn', 'function': {'arguments': '{"search_query":"brain plasticity November 2023"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 26, 'prompt_tokens': 1017, 'total_tokens': 1043, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b6c3b7bd-4d9d-4bf3-80c8-398c2fff3d21-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'search_query': 'brain plasticity November 2023'}, 'id': 'call_H4xmgXUNN4qYTrZ8GbX50RUn', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1017, 'output_tokens': 26, 'total_tokens': 1043, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_H4xmgXUNN4qYTrZ8GbX50RUn'), AIMessage(content="The latest findings in neuroscience regarding brain plasticity from November 2023 include the following studies:\n\n1. **Effects of Whole-Body Vibration on Sensorimotor Deficits and Brain Plasticity Among People with Chronic Ankle Instability**: This study explores the impact of whole-body vibration (WBV) on sensorimotor deficits and its correlation with plastic changes in the brain in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI).

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

This research reviews how ChatGPT writes English essays. This research is descriptive qualitative. The analysis shows that we can access ChatGPT on openai.com or chat.openai.com on the browser. If we do not have an account, we register via email, Google, or Microsoft account. After login, enter a question or statement in the conversation column provided. Send it and ChatGPT will respond and the answer appear quickly. The researcher tries ChatGPT “Can you help me in doing my English assignment?", and the ChatBot replies "Of course! I\'d be happy to help you with your English assignment. What do you need help with? Do you have a specific question or task that you\'re working on, or is there a broader topic that you\'d like help with? It would be helpful to have some more information so that I can better understand how I can assist you". Based on several tries, ChatGPT can answer all questions on various topics such as English essays including a descriptive text about Solo and My Family, recount text about personal experience and unforgettable moments, resolution in 2023, and future career. ChatGPT considers the event orders and writing order, including using main, explanatory sentences, and a conclusion. It uses two voices both active and passive voice. Besides, it considers tenses use related to the given topic essay. However, from examples of English essays produced by ChatGPT, it certainly requires further research to find out that the essay results are grammatically accurate.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employees’ skills and well-being in global labor markets: A systematic review\nAuthors: R. Cramarenco, Monica Ioana Burcă-Voicu, Dan-Cristian Dabija\nAbstract: Research background: This article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) is affecting workers\' personal and professional lives, because of many technological disruptions driven by the recent pandemic that are redefining global labor markets.\nPurpose of the article: The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic review of the relevant literature to identify the effects of technological change, especially the adoption of AI in organizations, on employees’ skills (professional dimension) and well-being (personal dimension).\nMethods: To implement the research scope, the authors relied on Khan\'s five-step methodology, which included a PRISMA flowchart with embedded keywords for selecting the appropriate quantitative data for the study. Firstly, 639 scientific papers published between March 2020 to March 2023 (the end of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the WHO) from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were selected. After applying the relevant procedures and techniques, 103 articles were retained, which focused on the professional dimension, while 35 papers were focused on the personal component.\nFindings & value added: Evidence has been presented highlighting the difficulties associated with the ongoing requirement for upskilling or reskilling as an adaptive reaction to technological changes. The efforts to counterbalance the skill mismatch impacted employees\' well-being in the challenging pandemic times. Although the emphasis on digital skills is widely accepted, our investigation shows that the topic is still not properly developed. The paper\'s most significant contributions are found in a thorough analysis of how AI affects workers\' skills and well-being, highlighting the most representative aspects researched by academic literature due to the recent paradigm changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and continuous technological disruptions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Radiology: A Deep Dive Into ChatGPT 4.0\'s Accuracy ', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_3w4EmYICOo8u3F0yj4SWXLtG'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_yzbW7I17m53T9Gvz0gwzoik0', 'function': {'arguments': '{"published_year": "2023"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 37, 'prompt_tokens': 974, 'total_tokens': 1011, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-51ae5492-57b9-4ca5-a222-27b36e4725ee-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'published_year': '2023'}, 'id': 'call_yzbW7I17m53T9Gvz0gwzoik0', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 974, 'output_tokens': 37, 'total_tokens': 1011, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_yzbW7I17m53T9Gvz0gwzoik0'), AIMessage(content="Here's a summary of the newest AI research papers from 2023:\n\n1. **Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in OpenAI ChatGPT application: A review of ChatGPT in writing English essays**: This research by Tira Nur Fitria reviews how ChatGPT assists in writing English essays.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the deprivin', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_v1HSWDn4qlSheO6Bmoncn1qn'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_QePfE4r61d5fF2xv70bcy9ko', 'function': {'arguments': '{"published_year":"2023"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 21, 'prompt_tokens': 1017, 'total_tokens': 1038, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-32e2f77b-9211-4d27-9e11-8253b008a1bd-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'published_year': '2023'}, 'id': 'call_QePfE4r61d5fF2xv70bcy9ko', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1017, 'output_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 1038, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_QePfE4r61d5fF2xv70bcy9ko'), AIMessage(content="Here are the key findings from the most recent research papers on brain plasticity from November 2023:\n\n1. **Effects of Whole-Body Vibration on Sensorimotor Deficits and Brain Plasticity Among People with Chronic Ankle Instability:**\n   - This study is investigating the impact of whole-body vibration (WBV) on individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI), characterized by symptoms like recurrent ankle sprains and sensorimotor deficits.\n   - The study aims to determine if the benefits of WBV, a treatment for CAI, are associated with plastic changes in the brain.\n   - The trial involves 80 participants divided into four groups: those receiving both WBV and balance training, those receiving only balance training, those receiving only WBV, and a control group.\n   - Key measures include sensorimotor function and brain plasticity, assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.\n   - This trial is significant as it is the first to explore the role of brain plasticity in the sensorimotor changes induced by WBV for CAI patients.\n\n2. **Maintaining a Dynamic Brain: A Review of Empirical Findings on Neuroplasticity (2017-2023):**\n   - This review highlights the brain's capacity to reorganize in response to environmental changes, learning, and experiences, a process known as neuroplasticity.\n   - It covers research from 2017 to 2023, focusing on the effects of exercise, learning, and environmental enrichment on neuroplasticity.\n   - The review emphasizes the brain's dynamic nature and its ability to respond to stimulating and depriving environments, which affects gene expression, neurotransmitter release, and neural connectivity.\n   - The rate of neuroplastic alterations varies across the lifespan, posing challenges for optimizing processes that benefit motor control, learning, memory, and recovery from injury.\n\nThese papers underscore the importance of neuroplasticity in both therapeutic settings and natural cognitive processes, highlighting innovative approaches to understanding and enhancing brain plasticity.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 409, 'prompt_tokens': 1050, 'total_tokens': 1459, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5fceb7e9-fab6-4418-b5d6-1a623bfeb955-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1050, 'output_tokens': 409, 'total_tokens': 1459, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Mateos-Garcia, Konstantinos Stathoulopoulos\nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?\nAuthors: Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen\nAbstract: The rapid growth of information in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the subfields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), presents a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners to keep pace with the latest developments. To address the problem of information overload, this report by the Natural Language Learning Group at Bielefeld University focuses on identifying the most popular papers on arXiv, with a specific emphasis on NLP and ML. The objective is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research, aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 list (noticing the top paper's focus on LLM related issues and higher number of co-authors) and analyze the citation distributions in our dataset, among others.\n\n\nPublished year: 2024\nTitle: Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research: ", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_wE8ToL72dA246WxT51cIwc4F'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_ZHresVonShyrPenUxDUAIC7C', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "A narrowing of AI research?"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_ykEE2qOxCRqFRVhqPxwMTa2l', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_9IYcaF2T9Oi188MuET2wwWpK', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research: "}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 110, 'prompt_tokens': 974, 'total_tokens': 1084, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c93431f4-1a63-4940-8f3c-6ff77baf1468-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'A narrowing of AI research?'}, 'id': 'call_ZHresVonShyrPenUxDUAIC7C', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?'}, 'id': 'call_ykEE2qOxCRqFRVhqPxwMTa2l', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research: '}, 'id': 'call_9IYcaF2T9Oi188MuET2wwWpK', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 974, 'output_tokens': 110, 'total_tokens': 1084, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_ZHresVonShyrPenUxDUAIC7C'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_ykEE2qOxCRqFRVhqPxwMTa2l'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_9IYcaF2T9Oi188MuET2wwWpK'), AIMessage(content='Here are the summaries of the newest AI research papers:\n\n1. **A narrowing of AI research?**: This paper examines the thematic diversity of AI research, particularly focusing on the dominance of deep learning and the role of private sector labs in shaping the field.

Tay, Liang Wang\nAbstract: Infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens remain a primary contributor to global health burdens. Prompt control and effective prevention of these pathogens are critical for public health and medical diagnostics. Conventional microbial detection methods suffer from high complexity, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity. Therefore, developing rapid and reliable methods for microbial pathogen detection has become imperative. Surface‐enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), as an innovative non‐invasive diagnostic technique, holds significant promise in pathogenic microorganism detection due to its rapid, reliable, and cost‐effective advantages. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental theories of Raman Spectroscopy (RS) with a focus on label‐free SERS strategy, reporting on the latest advancements of SERS technique in detecting bacteria, viruses, and fungi in clinical settings. Furthermore, we emphasize the application of machine learning algorithms in SERS spectral analysis. Finally, challenges faced by SERS application are probed, and the prospective development is discussed.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Latest Algorithms in Machine and Deep Learning Methods to Predict Retention Rates and Dropout in Higher Education: A Literature Review\nAuthors: Andy Prasetyo Utomo, Purwanto Purwanto, Bayu Surarso\nAbstract: External factors, such as global impact, or internal factors, such as educational services or the quality of learning, can affect the Retention rate or Number of Dropouts (DO) of students in higher education. Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Estévez, F. J. López-Tenllado, L. Aguado-Deblas, F. Bautista, A. Romero, D. Luna\nAbstract: Considering the renewable electricity production using sustainable technologies, such as solar photovoltaics or wind turbines, it is essential to have systems that allow for storing the energy produced during the periods of lower consumption as well as the energy transportation through the distribution network. Despite hydrogen being considered a good candidate, it presents several problems related to its extremely low density, which requires the use of very high pressures to store it. In addition, its energy density in volumetric terms is still clearly lower than that of most liquid fuels. These facts have led to the consideration of ammonia as an alternative compound for energy storage or as a carrier. In this sense, this review deals with the evaluation of using green ammonia for different energetic purposes, such as an energy carrier vector, an electricity generator and E-fuel. In addition, this study has addressed the latest studies that propose the use of nitrogen-derived compounds, i.e., urea, hydrazine, ammonium nitrate, etc., as alternative fuels. In this study, the possibility of using other nitrogen-derived compounds, i.e., an update of the ecosystem surrounding green ammonia, has been assessed, from production to consumption, including storage, transportation, etc. Additionally, the future challenges in achieving a technical and economically viable energy transition have been determined.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Application of Composite Materials for Energy Generation Devices\nAuthors: T. Trzepieciński, Temesgen Batu, Fasikaw Kibrete, H. Lemu\nAbstract: Globally, electricity demand rises by 1.8% per year; according to the American Energy Information Administration, global energy demand will increase by 47% over the next 30 years, driven by demographic and economic growth. Global demand for electricity is growing faster than renewable energy sources. Electricity production from renewable sources (i.e., biomass energy, geothermal energy, hydro energy, solar energy, tidal energy, wind energy) is on its way to strong growth around the world over the next dozen years. With the increasing demand for energy, new technologies and materials are being developed to replace exhaustible traditional construction materials. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the research into the application of composite materials in mainstream power generation. The main energy generation technologies, i.e., photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, and biogas generators, were analysed and discussed. The review presented in this article also covers the latest achievements and prospects for the use of composite materials in energy generation devices.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Redefining the Hydrogen “Colours” based on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: A New Evidence-Based Colour Code\nAuthors: Elena Ocenic, A. Tantau\nAbstract: Abstract This paper redefines hydrogen colour codes based on carbon dioxide emissions. It highlights that there are several colour codes, which disregard the carbon dioxide emitted in the hydrogen production process (e.g., electrolysis with renewable energy, steam reforming of natural gas, coal gasification, etc.). Some colours are used interchangeably for different technologies, while many colour codes do not assign a colour for all possible production pathways.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.\n\n\nPublished year: 2022\nTitle: Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nAuthors: Yuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu, Amanda Askell, John Kernion, Andy Jones, A.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the deprivin', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_3J29v2ChZ40n45CAJQFIPtXW'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_tWaKY0n3mXwGm3hsSmo7ZqKC', 'function': {'arguments': '{"semanticscholar_output":"Published year: 2023\\nTitle: Effects of whole-body vibration on sensorimotor deficits and brain plasticity among people with chronic ankle instability: a study protocol for a single-blind randomized controlled trial\\nAuthors: Jingwang Tan, Jiatao Li, Jianbin Lei, Shuyi Lu, Yongjian Feng, Tengyu Ma, L.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the deprivin', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_pNsQGGNu7lw76rfyrVZuLabH'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_e91wqfRQOCXtzJGsHJtkT1Ha', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input":"Effects of whole-body vibration on sensorimotor deficits and brain plasticity among people with chronic ankle instability: a study protocol for a single-blind randomized controlled trial"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 51, 'prompt_tokens': 1063, 'total_tokens': 1114, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d68244fb-400e-4e91-84c6-a2ec853ab37a-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'tool_input': 'Effects of whole-body vibration on sensorimotor deficits and brain plasticity among people with chronic ankle instability: a study protocol for a single-blind randomized controlled trial'}, 'id': 'call_e91wqfRQOCXtzJGsHJtkT1Ha', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1063, 'output_tokens': 51, 'total_tokens': 1114, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='This study protocol outlines a single-blind randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of whole-body vibration on sensorimotor deficits and brain plasticity in individuals with chronic ankle instability.

Berdiyorov, Yuriy Klapkiv, Sabina Sanetra-Półgrabi, Igor Komarnitskyi\nAbstract: Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in solving global energy and environmental issues, and the pace of the energy transition directly depends on improving their efficiency. Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.\nComputer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.\nARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. The ARPANET expanded rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.\nSeveral early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data networking. Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann pioneered a simplified end-to-end approach to internetworking at the IRIA. Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London in 1973. Bob Metcalfe developed the theory behind Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet. ARPA initiatives and the International Network Working Group developed and refined ideas for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Vint Cerf, now at Stanford University, and Bob Kahn, now at DARPA, published their research on internetworking in 1974. Through the Internet Experiment Note series and later RFCs this evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), two protocols of the Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. The development of packet switching networks was underpinned by mathematical work in the 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.\n\nIn the late 1970s, national and international public data networks emerged based on the X.25 protocol, designed by Rémi Després and others. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP on existing networks in the United States and around the world marked the beginnings of the Internet. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia. Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990. The optical backbone of the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic, as traffic transitioned to optical networks managed by Sp', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_sUvrqMZayU8iUrZza5mKWfDO'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_jbGvuUKYlRquKTGPFRmNbXYg', 'function': {'arguments': '{"search_query":"History of the Internet"}', 'name': 'WikipediaSummaryValidator'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 21, 'prompt_tokens': 985, 'total_tokens': 1006, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d5d8b872-a517-4143-b5c1-536e9c73b6bb-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'WikipediaSummaryValidator', 'args': {'search_query': 'History of the Internet'}, 'id': 'call_jbGvuUKYlRquKTGPFRmNbXYg', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 985, 'output_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 1006, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='WikipediaSummaryValidator', tool_call_id='call_jbGvuUKYlRquKTGPFRmNbXYg'), AIMessage(content="The history of the Internet began with efforts to develop inter-networked computer systems.

( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\nTesla is one of the world\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the "Tesla Takedown" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\n\n\n\nPage: Tesla Model Y\nSummary: The Tesla Model Y is a battery electric compact crossover SUV produced by Tesla, Inc. since 2020. The vehicle was presented in March 2019 as the company\'s fifth production model since its inception after the Roadster, Model S, Model X and Model 3.\nAfter its 2019 introduction, the Model Y started production at the Fremont Factory in California, US in January 2020. Production at Giga Shanghai, China was added in December 2020, and at Giga Texas, US since late 2021. Deliveries from Giga Berlin, Germany started in March 2022.\nThe Model Y is based on the Model 3 sedan and serves as a larger variant, with around 76 percent of parts being shared between the two and identical exterior and interior styling. While most Model Y are configured with two-row seating, in the US the Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity.\nIn 2023, Tesla delivered 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the world\'s best-selling vehicle that year, surpassing the Toyota Corolla and becoming the first electric vehicle to claim that title. With at least 2.16 million units delivered since its start of production up to December 2023, the Model Y is also the most popular electric vehicle of all time.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.\n\nPage: The Great Wall (film)\nSummary: The Great Wall (simplified Chinese: 长城; traditional Chinese: 長城) is a 2016 monster film directed by Zhang Yimou, with a screenplay by Carlo Bernard, Doug Miro and Tony Gilroy, from a story by Max Brooks, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz.

They sparked the "Beatlemania" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society\'s developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era\'s youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music\'s evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers\' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists\' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were "more popular than Jesus now".\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era\'s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".\nOver the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of "Yesterday" reaching 1,600 by 1986. As of 2009, they were the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide. Time included the Beatles in its list of the twentieth century\'s 100 most important people.\n\nPage: Beatles \'64\nSummary: Beatles \'64 is a documentary film directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends.

Harold was crowned king soon after Edward's death but faced multiple invasions, including from William and others. Before facing William, Harold defeated his brother Tostig and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066.\n\nWilliam's forces landed in England on 28 September 1066, establishing a foothold in the south. Harold moved swiftly southward to confront William, gathering forces along the way. The English army mainly consisted of infantry with few archers, while William's forces included infantry, cavalry, and archers.\n\nThe battle began around 9 am and lasted until dusk. Initially, the Normans struggled to break the English lines, but they used a tactic of feigned retreat to draw out and then turn on the English forces. Harold's death, likely near the battle's end, led to his army's retreat and defeat. William's victory at Hastings was crucial in his subsequent coronation as king on Christmas Day 1066.\n\nThe battle left significant casualties, with estimates suggesting around 2,000 invaders and twice that number of Englishmen perished.

The Internet Protocol Suite, which is the set of rules for communication between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States, with significant international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the UK and France.\n\nIn the late 1950s, computer science started to explore time-sharing between users and the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J.C.R. Licklider at the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) conceived the idea of a universal network. Independently, Paul Baran at RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies at the UK's National Physical Laboratory proposed packet switching.\n\nIn 1969, ARPA awarded contracts for the ARPANET project, which adopted packet switching technology. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was developed, and the host-to-host protocol was specified by UCLA graduate students. The ARPANET rapidly expanded in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIn the 1970s, several early packet-switched networks emerged, contributing to data networking research. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published their research on internetworking, which evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), forming the basis of the Internet protocol suite. The French CYCLADES project also influenced the design.\n\nBy the late 1970s, public data networks emerged, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded supercomputing centers and the NSFNET project in the U.S. These developments, along with international connections and the adoption of TCP/IP, marked the beginnings of the Internet. Commercial Internet service providers appeared in 1989, and by 1995, the optical backbone of the NSFNET was decommissioned, allowing the Internet to carry commercial traffic freely.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 393, 'prompt_tokens': 1791, 'total_tokens': 2184, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1664}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-2efb5820-6f08-49fc-91d8-20c49e1de38b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1791, 'output_tokens': 393, 'total_tokens': 2184, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1664}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_Jl9bGJfZdCNTVIZPHEEeuM4j'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_A25Y9XeGFARfTMDmJvGIx7Ml', 'function': {'arguments': '{"wikipedia_output":"Tesla, Inc.

Its origins trace back to the 7th century BC, with significant consolidation occurring during the Qin dynasty under the rule of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. This initial phase saw the connection of various state-built fortifications to form a continuous wall aimed at protecting the newly unified Qin dynasty.\n\nSuccessive Chinese dynasties, including the Han, Northern Qi, Jurchen-ruled Jin, and particularly the Ming dynasty, expanded and reinforced the wall. The Ming dynasty is responsible for most of the wall visible today, as they reconstructed it using stone and brick and extended it across challenging terrains. The wall incorporated watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, and signaling capabilities using smoke or fire, enhancing its defensive efficacy. Additionally, it served purposes beyond military defense, such as border controls, trade regulation, and the imposition of duties on goods along the Silk Road.\n\nThe Great Wall spans approximately 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, roughly delineating the edge of the Mongolian steppe. Although the wall was a formidable deterrent, it was not always successful in repelling invasions, such as in 1644 when Qing troops bypassed it through the Shanhai Pass to establish dominion over China.\n\nRecognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site and voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007, the Great Wall is an enduring symbol of China's historical ingenuity and strategic prowess.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent.

Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England.

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends.

Harold was crowned king soon after Edward's death but faced invasions from William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada.

King Harold died near the end of the battle, leading to the collapse of the English forces.\n\nFollowing the battle, William marched further, faced some resistance, but eventually was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.

J. C. R. Licklider of the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) developed the concept of a universal network, while independently, Paul Baran from the RAND Corporation and Donald Davies from the UK's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) proposed packet switching as a method for data transmission.\n\nIn 1969, ARPA initiated the ARPANET project, managed by Lawrence Roberts, incorporating packet-switching technology. This project quickly expanded across the U.S. and internationally, linking with the UK and Norway. In the 1970s, several packet-switched networks emerged, further developing the concepts of internetworking in which separate networks could connect. Key figures like Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published foundational research on internetworking, which led to the development of the TCP/IP protocols, pivotal for the Internet.\n\nThe late 1970s saw the rise of international data networks based on the X.25 protocol. The National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S. funded national supercomputing centers, creating NSFNET to connect these centers and allowing academic and research access.

Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\nTesla is one of the world\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the "Tesla Takedown" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\n\n\n\nPage: History of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company is named after Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla is the world\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and, as of the end of 2021, Tesla\'s cumulative global vehicle sales totaled 2.3 million units.\n\n\n\nPage: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. has been criticized for its cars, workplace culture, business practices, and occupational safety. Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_jfEqNS9IZ8USEX4W3apMRZWu'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_JV9NkGOL9Ml6LK7XGLblBUj9', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input":"Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.\n\nPage: The Great Wall (film)\nSummary: The Great Wall (simplified Chinese: 长城; traditional Chinese: 長城) is a 2016 monster film directed by Zhang Yimou, with a screenplay by Carlo Bernard, Doug Miro and Tony Gilroy, from a story by Max Brooks, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz.

In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers\' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists\' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks.

Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era\'s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".\nOver the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of "Yesterday" reaching 1,600 by 1986.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority ove", name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_yvg8IqccsUklXOqB1i7z10D5'), ToolMessage(content='The Battle of Hastings was a minor skirmish in English history, fought on October 14, 1066.
