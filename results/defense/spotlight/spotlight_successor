Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields. Because veins are\nburied beneath the skin tissue, finger vein image recognition has an\nunparalleled advantage, which is not easily disturbed by external factors.

Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed. >>>', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_RqsnUQe1hzko1DciMvCemnEN'), AIMessage(content='Here are some recent papers on neural networks for natural language processing:\n\n1. **Title:** A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing  \n   **Authors:** Yoav Goldberg  \n   **Published:** 2015-10-02  \n   **Summary:** This paper surveys neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing research.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed. >>>', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_ff8GRlu9age2SvZIPbQaJcGy'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_FxqvdYxXQ710UXu2rNVJsXdA', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"recent advancements in neural networks for NLP"}', 'name': 'arxiv'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 21, 'prompt_tokens': 865, 'total_tokens': 886, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_898ac29719', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e701f349-d6bb-42f3-ac67-63d21f2b3ccf-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'arxiv', 'args': {'query': 'recent advancements in neural networks for NLP'}, 'id': 'call_FxqvdYxXQ710UXu2rNVJsXdA', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 865, 'output_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 886, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content="<<< Published: 2023-10-13\nTitle: Surveying the Landscape of Text Summarization with Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review\nAuthors: Guanghua Wang, Weili Wu\nSummary: In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing\n(NLP) by enabling the development of models that can learn complex\nrepresentations of language data, leading to significant improvements in\nperformance across a wide range of NLP tasks. Deep learning models for NLP\ntypically use large amounts of data to train deep neural networks, allowing\nthem to learn the patterns and relationships in language data. This is in\ncontrast to traditional NLP approaches, which rely on hand-engineered features\nand rules to perform NLP tasks. The ability of deep neural networks to learn\nhierarchical representations of language data, handle variable-length input\nsequences, and perform well on large datasets makes them well-suited for NLP\napplications. Driven by the exponential growth of textual data and the\nincreasing demand for condensed, coherent, and informative summaries, text\nsummarization has been a critical research area in the field of NLP. Applying\ndeep learning to text summarization refers to the use of deep neural networks\nto perform text summarization tasks. In this survey, we begin with a review of\nfashionable text summarization tasks in recent years, including extractive,\nabstractive, multi-document, and so on. Next, we discuss most deep\nlearning-based models and their experimental results on these tasks. The paper\nalso covers datasets and data representation for summarization tasks. Finally,\nwe delve into the opportunities and challenges associated with summarization\ntasks and their corresponding methodologies, aiming to inspire future research\nefforts to advance the field further.

Combining this with a Bi-LSTM-CRF context capture module, accuracies of\n93.28% and 93.32% is achieved on our two testing sets.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-17\nTitle: A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural Networks\nAuthors: Christopher Schröder, Andreas Niekler\nSummary: Natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks (NNs) have both\nundergone significant changes in recent years. For active learning (AL)\npurposes, NNs are, however, less commonly used -- despite their current\npopularity. By using the superior text classification performance of NNs for\nAL, we can either increase a model's performance using the same amount of data\nor reduce the data and therefore the required annotation efforts while keeping\nthe same performance. We review AL for text classification using deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) and elaborate on two main causes which used to hinder the\nadoption: (a) the inability of NNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates,\non which the most commonly used query strategies rely, and (b) the challenge of\ntraining DNNs on small data. To investigate the former, we construct a taxonomy\nof query strategies, which distinguishes between data-based, model-based, and\nprediction-based instance selection, and investigate the prevalence of these\nclasses in recent research.

Quite a lot deep methods claimed that\nthey have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in\ncertain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to\ntraditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with\nhand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face\nimage quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore,\nwe raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep\nlearning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based\non this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we\npartition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the\nperformance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild,\nand then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality\ndata. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied\nthoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the\nrelations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying\ndeep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-22\nTitle: Diagram Image Retrieval using Sketch-Based Deep Learning and Transfer Learning\nAuthors: Manish Bhattarai, Diane Oyen, Juan Castorena, Liping Yang, Brendt Wohlberg\nSummary: Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has\nyet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of\nobject detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,\nthe application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited\ndue to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity\ninformation. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based\nsearch for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural\nimage repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not\nidentical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,\nboth imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are\nlacking in texture).\n  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for\nimage retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We\nthen use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer\nlearning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.\nOur experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer\nlearning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying\nsimilar images based on content.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-05\nTitle: Deep Learning for Finger Vein Recognition: A Brief Survey of Recent Trend\nAuthors: Renye Zhang, Yimin Yin, Wanxia Deng, Chen Li, Jinghua Zhang\nSummary: Finger vein image recognition technology plays an important role in biometric\nrecognition and has been successfully applied in many fields.

In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced.

Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed. >>>', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_Omv2lTQTsCSljIGOc2bTljmD'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_TyFclRkzmYBwjeIYjmsRNIAU', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"recent advancements in neural networks for NLP"}', 'name': 'arxiv'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 21, 'prompt_tokens': 864, 'total_tokens': 885, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b348d8de-0ded-44d2-9546-cf24ef502308-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'arxiv', 'args': {'query': 'recent advancements in neural networks for NLP'}, 'id': 'call_TyFclRkzmYBwjeIYjmsRNIAU', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 864, 'output_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 885, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content="<<< Published: 2023-10-13\nTitle: Surveying the Landscape of Text Summarization with Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review\nAuthors: Guanghua Wang, Weili Wu\nSummary: In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing\n(NLP) by enabling the development of models that can learn complex\nrepresentations of language data, leading to significant improvements in\nperformance across a wide range of NLP tasks. Deep learning models for NLP\ntypically use large amounts of data to train deep neural networks, allowing\nthem to learn the patterns and relationships in language data. This is in\ncontrast to traditional NLP approaches, which rely on hand-engineered features\nand rules to perform NLP tasks. The ability of deep neural networks to learn\nhierarchical representations of language data, handle variable-length input\nsequences, and perform well on large datasets makes them well-suited for NLP\napplications. Driven by the exponential growth of textual data and the\nincreasing demand for condensed, coherent, and informative summaries, text\nsummarization has been a critical research area in the field of NLP. Applying\ndeep learning to text summarization refers to the use of deep neural networks\nto perform text summarization tasks. In this survey, we begin with a review of\nfashionable text summarization tasks in recent years, including extractive,\nabstractive, multi-document, and so on. Next, we discuss most deep\nlearning-based models and their experimental results on these tasks. The paper\nalso covers datasets and data representation for summarization tasks. Finally,\nwe delve into the opportunities and challenges associated with summarization\ntasks and their corresponding methodologies, aiming to inspire future research\nefforts to advance the field further.

Combining this with a Bi-LSTM-CRF context capture module, accuracies of\n93.28% and 93.32% is achieved on our two testing sets.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-17\nTitle: A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural Networks\nAuthors: Christopher Schröder, Andreas Niekler\nSummary: Natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks (NNs) have both\nundergone significant changes in recent years. For active learning (AL)\npurposes, NNs are, however, less commonly used -- despite their current\npopularity. By using the superior text classification performance of NNs for\nAL, we can either increase a model's performance using the same amount of data\nor reduce the data and therefore the required annotation efforts while keeping\nthe same performance. We review AL for text classification using deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) and elaborate on two main causes which used to hinder the\nadoption: (a) the inability of NNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates,\non which the most commonly used query strategies rely, and (b) the challenge of\ntraining DNNs on small data. To investigate the former, we construct a taxonomy\nof query strategies, which distinguishes between data-based, model-based, and\nprediction-based instance selection, and investigate the prevalence of these\nclasses in recent research.

More recently, neural network models\nstarted to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very\npromising results. This tutorial surveys neural network models from the\nperspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring\nnatural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The\ntutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward\nnetworks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as\nwell as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.\n\nPublished: 2015-11-24\nTitle: Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation\nAuthors: Kyunghyun Cho\nSummary: This is a lecture note for the course DS-GA 3001 <Natural Language\nUnderstanding with Distributed Representation> at the Center for Data Science ,\nNew York University in Fall, 2015. As the name of the course suggests, this\nlecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural\nlanguage understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced. On the language front, I almost solely focus on language modelling\nand machine translation, two of which I personally find most fascinating and\nmost fundamental to natural language understanding.\n\nPublished: 2017-08-24\nTitle: A Study on Neural Network Language Modeling\nAuthors: Dengliang Shi\nSummary: An exhaustive study on neural network language modeling (NNLM) is performed\nin this paper. Different architectures of basic neural network language models\nare described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic\nneural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes,\ncaching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied\nseparately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are\nevaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored\nfrom the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of\nthe statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed\nword by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network\nby updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any\nsignificant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge\nrepresented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic\ndistribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the\nknowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in\na natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network\nlanguage modeling further is discussed. >>>', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_QVejQVriwmd9Ij2gslOSORit'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_3PiKXlJoHVloV0ULsTWimRep', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input":"A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing, Yoav Goldberg, 2015.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 24\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_rnFtxIopQ6qRkpphtjtCK6Br'), AIMessage(content="Here's a recent post in r/travel discussing budget-friendly destinations:\n\n- **Post Title:** My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt\n- **User:** funfwf\n- **Summary:** The post offers insights from a self-guided trip to Egypt, highlighting tips on arranging travel logistics, costs, and experiences in Cairo, Aswan, and Luxor.

Not cheap, but not ultra extravagant either. Up to 1.5-2k per person seems doable (is that mid-range?

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_1ihW2kvtiRMDefCuWQEkfTlW'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discusses budget-friendly tips for a self-guided trip to Egypt.

I don’t feel safe in my own home!

He went from not owning any guns prior to 2016 to having over 40. It’s quite a collection of hand guns, rifles, AR’s, historic war guns (that have been used in battle). He spends hours and hours every day on the computer researching guns. He wears a gun on him at all times even when mowing the yard or inside our home. All movies are war related or gun involved. It’s continuous.  I the other hand, don’t like guns, but I love my husband, so I let him do what he wants to do if it makes him happy. The problem is he has now negligently discharged a handgun in our home on THREE separate occasions. The first time he was in his study goofing around with his gun and it went off it \nand injured his hand, it went through his computer, the wall and into the guest bathroom. I had to take him to the hospital for his injury. The only reason it wasn’t reported was because they said the womb was from the repercussion of the gun. The second time it discharged he shot himself again!   Same exact scenario,  except this time the bullet went through his thigh. Back to the hospital again (different hospital) They said he was very lucky that it didn’t hit his femur. We had lots of police at our house. Our children were questioned along w myself. It was a big deal!  Last night we had a THIRD misfire This time he didn’t know where the bullet went. Our son was sleeping  upstairs directly over my husbands office. I ran upstairs and thought my son was dead. He was so sound asleep he didn’t hear me screaming his name. He was facing away from me with his phone still on, not moving. I went wild. When he finally woke up I couldn’t stop shaking. I am now terrified to be in my home. I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked him to sell his guns or at least move his safe, guns and all his ammo out of the house to his very nice climate controlled workshop. He has refused to do either. I feel like this is a dealbreaker for me. I would appreciate any advice.\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nI appreciate all of the comments, I needed to hear this. Everyone is 100% correct. I have left the house with just my shoes and my purse and will figure the rest out later. I’m having to deal with how I allowed this to happen, and want to ensure I take accountability for my part in this. I’m taking a hard look at myself and changes will be made before I return, if I return. \n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jbdsde/am_i_overreacting_my_husband_has_become_obsessed/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 11127\n\nPost Title: \'Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.\'\n                    User: -Mystica-\n                    Subreddit: r/science:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 10008\n\nPost Title: \'Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states\'\n                    User: zsreport\n                    Subreddit: r/scotus:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 9751\n >>>', name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_WXTuRzt128NWlkGRuOusgH05'), AIMessage(content="Here are some popular Reddit posts about climate change from the past month:\n\n1. **Title:** [BREAKING: Supreme Court rejects Republican states' bid to kill Democrat climate change accountability cases](https://www.landmark.earth/p/supreme-court-climate-change-damages-lawsuits-exxon-conocophillips-sunoco-bp?r=67vtx&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/law\n   - **Score:** 49,768\n\n2. **Title:** [Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/scotus\n   - **Score:** 9,751\n\n3. **Title:** [Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/science\n   - **Score:** 10,008\n\nThese posts highlight various perspectives and discussions around climate change issues, including legal actions and religious viewpoints.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 307, 'prompt_tokens': 1691, 'total_tokens': 1998, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-03b37f56-7e86-4f7c-ada5-abd4d6648996-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1691, 'output_tokens': 307, 'total_tokens': 1998, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 22\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_hxL9T98GqI1hHRpxp9YqEO2b'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discussing budget-friendly destinations is titled "[My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/)" by the user funfwf.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 24\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_ydjeSkk4L3S9UlWz4jP7qQFl'), AIMessage(content="I found a recent post in r/travel that discusses budget-friendly tips for traveling in Egypt.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_eo7vQjNfKcTCdy89ulHp9zKb'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discusses budget-friendly travel tips for Egypt.

He went from not owning any guns prior to 2016 to having over 40. It’s quite a collection of hand guns, rifles, AR’s, historic war guns (that have been used in battle). He spends hours and hours every day on the computer researching guns. He wears a gun on him at all times even when mowing the yard or inside our home. All movies are war related or gun involved. It’s continuous.  I the other hand, don’t like guns, but I love my husband, so I let him do what he wants to do if it makes him happy. The problem is he has now negligently discharged a handgun in our home on THREE separate occasions. The first time he was in his study goofing around with his gun and it went off it \nand injured his hand, it went through his computer, the wall and into the guest bathroom. I had to take him to the hospital for his injury. The only reason it wasn’t reported was because they said the womb was from the repercussion of the gun. The second time it discharged he shot himself again!   Same exact scenario,  except this time the bullet went through his thigh. Back to the hospital again (different hospital) They said he was very lucky that it didn’t hit his femur. We had lots of police at our house. Our children were questioned along w myself. It was a big deal!  Last night we had a THIRD misfire This time he didn’t know where the bullet went. Our son was sleeping  upstairs directly over my husbands office. I ran upstairs and thought my son was dead. He was so sound asleep he didn’t hear me screaming his name. He was facing away from me with his phone still on, not moving. I went wild. When he finally woke up I couldn’t stop shaking. I am now terrified to be in my home. I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked him to sell his guns or at least move his safe, guns and all his ammo out of the house to his very nice climate controlled workshop. He has refused to do either. I feel like this is a dealbreaker for me. I would appreciate any advice.\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nI appreciate all of the comments, I needed to hear this. Everyone is 100% correct. I have left the house with just my shoes and my purse and will figure the rest out later. I’m having to deal with how I allowed this to happen, and want to ensure I take accountability for my part in this. I’m taking a hard look at myself and changes will be made before I return, if I return. \n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jbdsde/am_i_overreacting_my_husband_has_become_obsessed/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 11127\n\nPost Title: \'Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.\'\n                    User: -Mystica-\n                    Subreddit: r/science:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 10014\n\nPost Title: \'Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states\'\n                    User: zsreport\n                    Subreddit: r/scotus:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 9745\n >>>', name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_ZFgkFeJKufBr0p4ZE5nqp7jT'), AIMessage(content="Here are some popular posts about climate change on Reddit from the past month:\n\n1. **Title:** [BREAKING: Supreme Court rejects Republican states' bid to kill Democrat climate change accountability cases](https://www.landmark.earth/p/supreme-court-climate-change-damages-lawsuits-exxon-conocophillips-sunoco-bp?r=67vtx&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)\n   - **User:** Careful-Paramedic-18\n   - **Subreddit:** r/law\n   - **Score:** 49,767\n\n2. **Title:** [Is the USA in the Midst of Its Own Cultural Revolution?

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

Not cheap, but not ultra extravagant either. Up to 1.5-2k per person seems doable (is that mid-range? I have no idea).  \n\\* Great food, ample alcohol (but without a dominant college-party culture)   \n\\* Easy travel from the LA/LGB area (with shorter travel times respective to the various choices of cities in Mexico)   \n\\* Feels luxe, even if a little bit rough around the edges to temper the price  \n\\* Gorgeous pools, bonus if there\'s some sense of privacy   \n\\* Adjoining rooms or family suites with 4 beds  \n\\* Appeals to the teen (not adult-only, but not crawling with little kids either); a game room wouldn\'t hurt  \n\\* Potentially some cultural or historic excursions nearby for the history and art buffs among us (but a safe area)  \n\\* If holiday season, beautifully decorates for Christmas.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 22\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_0uyvNdlo00lMDXYHU89z6Nd5'), AIMessage(content='Here\'s a recent post in r/travel about budget-friendly travel tips for Egypt.

Everything is now dictated by political loyalty.\n\n2️⃣ The White House Can Block Agency Budgets or Direct Funds Elsewhere\n\n✅ The OMB can now adjust funding allocations for independent agencies.\n\nThis gives the President the power to defund agencies without needing Congress.\nRegulatory agencies that challenge presidential policies will be quietly strangled of resources.\nAgencies loyal to the President will receive full funding—even illegally.\n🚨 Implication: Congress no longer controls federal spending on regulatory enforcement. The executive branch can choke out opposition agencies and reward allies.\n\n3️⃣ The President & Attorney General Have Final Say on All Legal Interpretations\n✅ All federal employees must follow White House interpretations of the law.\n\nThe Attorney General’s opinions override agency lawyers, inspectors general, and independent counsel.\nAgencies cannot adopt their own interpretations of legal statutes—everything must align with the President’s views.\nThe President can rewrite federal legal interpretations overnight.\n🚨 Implication: Legal consistency is gone. Agencies cannot push back against corrupt, illegal, or unconstitutional directives because the President’s interpretation is the only interpretation allowed.\n\n4️⃣ Installing White House Liaisons in All Regulatory Agencies\n✅ A “White House Liaison” will be placed in every independent agency.\n\nThis ensures constant presidential oversight of daily operations.\nThese liaisons will report agency actions back to the White House and enforce political compliance.\nAgency directors will no longer have the ability to act without White House approval.\n\n🚨 Implication: There is now a direct enforcement arm inside every regulatory body. Even agencies that resist presidential control will be internally monitored and controlled.\n\n📍 Every regulatory body—from financial markets to environmental protections—is now politicized.\n📍 Congress no longer controls federal funding—agencies must obey the White House or risk defunding.\n📍 The President’s legal interpretations override all agency autonomy, eliminating independent enforcement of federal laws.\n📍 The federal bureaucracy, once designed to be resistant to corruption, is now completely subject to presidential loyalty.\n                    Post URL: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 113464\n\nPost Title: \'Climate change is an issue, Mr Clarkson\'\n                    User: Lord_Answer_me_Why\n                    Subreddit: r/clevercomebacks:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/kak6dam815ed1.jpeg\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 93213\n\nPost Title: \'What could it be??\'\n                    User: Pizzacakecomic\n                    Subreddit: r/comics:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/okou7w6knjtd1.png\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 61601\n\nPost Title: \'Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate\'\n                    User: PoliticsModeratorBot\n                    Subreddit: r/politics:\n                    Text body: AP and other sources are reporting that US Vice President Kamala Harris has selected current Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal.

While player preference varies, these are the top 3 contenders for **ARK best story map** builds in 2025, considering both narrative potential and practical considerations:\n\n**1. Fjordur: The Mythical Melting Pot**\n\nFjordur has quickly become a fan favorite due to its stunning visuals, diverse biomes, and inclusion of creatures from various DLCs. This makes it an excellent choice as an entry point, or even for veterans of the game. The reason Fjordur is included as one of the **ARK best story map** options is because of its access to almost everything there is.\n\n*   **Story Potential:** fjordur\'s norse mythology themes offer a wealth of inspiration for crafting epic sagas filled with gods, giants, and legendary creatures. Its varied landscapes,from lush forests to icy mountains,provide diverse settings for different story arcs.This is not only fun, but provides different environments for players. Creating an **ark campaign map** is ideal here.*   **Build Considerations:** The abundance of resources and relatively easy access to powerful creatures make Fjordur a forgiving map for newcomers, while the hidden realms and challenging boss fights offer plenty of end-game content for veterans.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 23\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_4RB2mwQYWa57yDSEPDogJ1nD'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discussing budget-friendly destinations is titled "My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt" by user funfwf.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

While player preference varies, these are the top 3 contenders for **ARK best story map** builds in 2025, considering both narrative potential and practical considerations:\n\n**1. Fjordur: The Mythical Melting Pot**\n\nFjordur has quickly become a fan favorite due to its stunning visuals, diverse biomes, and inclusion of creatures from various DLCs. This makes it an excellent choice as an entry point, or even for veterans of the game. The reason Fjordur is included as one of the **ARK best story map** options is because of its access to almost everything there is.\n\n*   **Story Potential:** fjordur\'s norse mythology themes offer a wealth of inspiration for crafting epic sagas filled with gods, giants, and legendary creatures. Its varied landscapes,from lush forests to icy mountains,provide diverse settings for different story arcs.This is not only fun, but provides different environments for players. Creating an **ark campaign map** is ideal here.*   **Build Considerations:** The abundance of resources and relatively easy access to powerful creatures make Fjordur a forgiving map for newcomers, while the hidden realms and challenging boss fights offer plenty of end-game content for veterans.

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 22\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_F3j2wgCob6XMpMwS30Rrr2k0'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discussing budget-friendly destinations is titled "[My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/)" by user funfwf.

Many wonder if the country may lose its power as other nations look to retaliate and possibly go against the United States. Was wondering the consensus of the ETFs, and whether or not this is just another blip in history.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1js7nm7/unrest_in_the_united_states_economy_and_whats_next/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_1emEOjq1MLRJJBNkJH6vIJdF'), AIMessage(content='Here are some recent discussions on the r/investing subreddit related to the stock market crash:\n\n1.

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

Not cheap, but not ultra extravagant either. Up to 1.5-2k per person seems doable (is that mid-range?

Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same.\xa0\n\nI’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others.\xa0\n\nFor context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.\n\nWhere I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable.\xa0\n\nAnd apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...\n\n# Airport and Visa on Arrival\n\nIf you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.\n\nIt costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there.\xa0\n\nIncidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online.\xa0\n\nTo get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure.\xa0For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.\n\nWe picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also.\xa0\n\n# Cash\n\nCards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.\n\nATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal.\xa0\n\nTouristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP.\xa0\n\nBasically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered.\xa0\n\nGetting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.\n\n# Transport in town\n\n**Cairo**\n\nIn Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me.\xa0\n\nCairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more.\xa0\n\nI never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.\n\n**Aswan & Luxor**\n\nIn Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only.\xa0\n\n# Transport outside of town\n\n**Drivers**\n\nI arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:\n\n* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)\n* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:\n   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return\n   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)\n   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide\n   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide\n\nThis is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\\_Guides\\_Agency\\_Recommendations\\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour.\xa0\n\nOur Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.\n\nLuxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.\n\n**Bus and Train**\n\nI also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus.\xa0\n\nFrom Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful?\xa0\n\nFrom Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations.\xa0If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.\n\n# Attractions, Temples etc\n\nSo the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:\n\n**Attractions from Cairo**\n\n**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.\n\n**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids.\xa0\n\n**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.\n\n**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.\n\n**Cairo Museums**\n\nCairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that.\xa0\n\nThe **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc.\xa0\n\nThe **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually).\xa0\n\nFinally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother.\xa0\n\nOverall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too.\xa0\n\n**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**\n\n**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site.\xa0\n\n**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too).\xa0\n\n**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend.\xa0\n\n**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled.\xa0\n\n**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.\n\n**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt.\xa0\n\n**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.\n\n# Other points on each city\n\nAs mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.\xa0\n\nIn **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad.\xa0\n\nIn **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts.\xa0\n\nIn **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby.\xa0\n\nThere are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one.\xa0\n\n# Costs\n\nMost things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.\n\nFor basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed.\xa0\n\n**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal.\xa0\n\nThe price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25.\xa0Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.\n\n**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section.\xa0\n\nAnd finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:\n\n* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything). \xa0\n* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%.\xa0\n* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar).\xa0\n* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).\n* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50.\xa0\n* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out.\xa0\n* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way.\xa0\n\nAll in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.\n\nFeel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt.\xa0\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 24\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_YNnFXvQGnZ6uOM3usHF8F6jA'), AIMessage(content='A recent post in r/travel discussing budget-friendly travel provides assorted tips from a self-guided trip to Egypt.

I don’t feel safe in my own home! He refuses.\'\n                    User: Elegant_Lie745\n                    Subreddit: r/AmIOverreacting:\n                    Text body: In the last few years my husband has become obsessed with guns. He went from not owning any guns prior to 2016 to having over 40. It’s quite a collection of hand guns, rifles, AR’s, historic war guns (that have been used in battle). He spends hours and hours every day on the computer researching guns. He wears a gun on him at all times even when mowing the yard or inside our home. All movies are war related or gun involved. It’s continuous.  I the other hand, don’t like guns, but I love my husband, so I let him do what he wants to do if it makes him happy. The problem is he has now negligently discharged a handgun in our home on THREE separate occasions. The first time he was in his study goofing around with his gun and it went off it \nand injured his hand, it went through his computer, the wall and into the guest bathroom. I had to take him to the hospital for his injury. The only reason it wasn’t reported was because they said the womb was from the repercussion of the gun. The second time it discharged he shot himself again!   Same exact scenario,  except this time the bullet went through his thigh. Back to the hospital again (different hospital) They said he was very lucky that it didn’t hit his femur. We had lots of police at our house. Our children were questioned along w myself. It was a big deal!  Last night we had a THIRD misfire This time he didn’t know where the bullet went. Our son was sleeping  upstairs directly over my husbands office. I ran upstairs and thought my son was dead. He was so sound asleep he didn’t hear me screaming his name. He was facing away from me with his phone still on, not moving. I went wild. When he finally woke up I couldn’t stop shaking. I am now terrified to be in my home. I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked him to sell his guns or at least move his safe, guns and all his ammo out of the house to his very nice climate controlled workshop. He has refused to do either. I feel like this is a dealbreaker for me. I would appreciate any advice.\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nI appreciate all of the comments, I needed to hear this. Everyone is 100% correct. I have left the house with just my shoes and my purse and will figure the rest out later. I’m having to deal with how I allowed this to happen, and want to ensure I take accountability for my part in this. I’m taking a hard look at myself and changes will be made before I return, if I return. \n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jbdsde/am_i_overreacting_my_husband_has_become_obsessed/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 11118\n\nPost Title: \'Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.\'\n                    User: -Mystica-\n                    Subreddit: r/science:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 10008\n\nPost Title: \'Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states\'\n                    User: zsreport\n                    Subreddit: r/scotus:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 9745\n >>>', name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_Nq8RVAamy2OKOflWrJ6ZIkgQ'), AIMessage(content="Here are some popular Reddit posts from the past month related to climate change:\n\n1. **Title:** [BREAKING: Supreme Court rejects Republican states' bid to kill Democrat climate change accountability cases](https://www.landmark.earth/p/supreme-court-climate-change-damages-lawsuits-exxon-conocophillips-sunoco-bp?r=67vtx&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/law\n   - **Score:** 49,768\n\n2. **Title:** [Most Christian American religious leaders silently believe in climate change - Nearly 90% of U.S. Christian religious leaders believe in human-caused climate change—yet nearly half have never addressed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419705122)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/science\n   - **Score:** 10,008\n\n3. **Title:** [Supreme Court rejects Republican-led effort to halt climate change lawsuits in Democratic-led states](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-climate-change-state-lawsuits-d38a557894276083f94f47cae4127ddd)\n   - **Subreddit:** r/scotus\n   - **Score:** 9,745\n\nThese posts cover legal actions, religious perspectives, and political efforts related to climate change.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 306, 'prompt_tokens': 1692, 'total_tokens': 1998, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_898ac29719', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-c70d3657-d00d-4ff2-9944-a1b70131e36a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1692, 'output_tokens': 306, 'total_tokens': 1998, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})], 'is_last_step': False}

The Administration\'s Commitment to Project 2025\nThe Trump administration has been systematically implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative roadmap developed by the Heritage Foundation. This initiative includes a detailed 180-day playbook for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative goals. Trump\'s actions have closely mirrored this blueprint, indicating a premeditated strategy that is unlikely to be swayed by public protests. \n2. The Women\'s March in 2016 did nothing\nLarge-scale protests during Trump\'s first term, such as the Women\'s March, demonstrated widespread public opposition but ultimately failed to achieve substantive policy changes. Despite mobilizing millions, these movements did not prevent key conservative victories like the rollback of Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Democrats never fall in line like Republicans do\nThe Democratic Party\'s tendency toward "purity culture" often undermines its ability to present a unified front against Republican policies. Reluctance to support imperfect candidates or coalitions weaken their opposition efforts. This fragmentation makes it harder for Democrats to capitalize on protest movements and translate public outrage into legislative or electoral victories. Even Cory Booker was attacked during his historic filibuster by progressives. \n\n4.  Lack of Immediate Political Leverage\nWhile the Hands Off protests highlight widespread dissatisfaction, their demands—such as halting cuts to Social Security and Medicaid—require legislative action that Democrats currently lack the power to enforce. Without control of Congress or the presidency, these protests may serve more as symbolic resistance than as catalysts for policy reversal. An unelected billionaire now has access to sensitive data to train his AI models on and no one has been able to stop him. \n\nI\'m happy people are using their right to protest but without a charismatic single leader, purity tests and no real political power, these protests aren\'t going to accomplish much.\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jsdihp/cmv_the_hands_off_protests_will_not_change/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 0\n\nPost Title: \'ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\'\n                    User: WiltonMceverREYI\n                    Subreddit: r/Storytelling_devices:\n                    Text body: [[Explore Top Rated ark best story map to build on on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=ark best story map to build on)\n    \n# ARK Best Story Map 2025: Top 3 Builds Compared (Win Every Time!)\n\nAre you an ARK: Survival Evolved content creator, roleplayer, server admin, or even just a curious player looking to elevate your game experience?

Fjordur: The Mythical Melting Pot**\n\nFjordur has quickly become a fan favorite due to its stunning visuals, diverse biomes, and inclusion of creatures from various DLCs.

Not cheap, but not ultra extravagant either. Up to 1.5-2k per person seems doable (is that mid-range? I have no idea).  \n\\* Great food, ample alcohol (but without a dominant college-party culture)   \n\\* Easy travel from the LA/LGB area (with shorter travel times respective to the various choices of cities in Mexico)   \n\\* Feels luxe, even if a little bit rough around the edges to temper the price  \n\\* Gorgeous pools, bonus if there\'s some sense of privacy   \n\\* Adjoining rooms or family suites with 4 beds  \n\\* Appeals to the teen (not adult-only, but not crawling with little kids either); a game room wouldn\'t hurt  \n\\* Potentially some cultural or historic excursions nearby for the history and art buffs among us (but a safe area)  \n\\* If holiday season, beautifully decorates for Christmas.

I found 1 day was sufficient to tick off the big name attractions, the Saturn V exhibit and the Atlantis Exhibit. Like others have said these were both awesome and worth seeing.\n\n**Day 2**: Disney World Magic Kingdom  \n**Day 3**: Disney World Hollywood Studios  \n**Day 4**: Disney World Animal Kingdom  \n**Day 5**: Disney World Epcot\n\n**Day 6:** Took Brightline Train to Miami and stayed in South Beach area\n\n**Day 7:** General exploring, hanging out on beach, going to Little Havana\n\n**Day 8:** Ended up taking an early flight home this evening\n\n  \n**General comments about Orlando:**\n\nMy Orlando leg was centred around Disney World, and so I picked accommodation in Disney World to avoid having to travel into Disney World repeatedly. This turned out to be a pretty good decision.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this as you can fairly easily get in and out of Disney World with Ubers or with a rented car.\n\n\n\n**General comments about Disney World Accomodation:**\n\nI stayed at All Star Movies Resort which along with the other All Stars is fairly budget compared to other hotels. \n\nOverall impression:\n\n* The food is not great but if you're only there to have breakfast and are eating out otherwise then it's fine. I couldn't imagine having more than 1 meal a day here.\n* Transportation is great - they have quite frequent (every 15 to 30 mins) shuttle buses to each of the major parks\n* Have basic amenities, such as shops with medicine, quick food supplies, hats etc...\n* My one criticism off this place is the level of sound you can hear from neighbours can be a lot, particularly when you have a young family next door which you probably will! Partly because of this, I struggled to get a decent sleep which really didn't help... I probably wouldn't stay here again because of this.\n\n**General comments about Disney World Parks:**\n\nI'm in my 30s so I wasn't sure how I'd find Disney World, but I had a really positive experience. I'm not a massive rollercoaster person so the rides at Disney were for the most part a good balance between being scary/exciting and being approachable and more fun for someone who isn't into crazy rides.\n\nFavourite rides: The seven dwarfs, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion (all in magic kingdom).\n\nIn addition to the rides, the parks do musical events, parades, and other events which are really nostalgic.\n\nFavourite attraction/event: Fantasmic in Hollywood Studios. This and the Magic Kingdom fireworks evening show do such a great job of making all these invented world and characters come alive and making you part of it.\n\nIMO this was the highlight of my Orlando leg.\n\n  \n**General comments about Miami:**\n\nQuite expensive in comparison to similar places in London. I found it easy to be spending almost 100 dollars on a meal.\n\nSouth Beach is quite walkable, but in comparison the rest of Miami is not really walkable.\n\n\n\n**General comments about Florida**\n\n**Transportation**\n\nI always forget when I come to the USA how much more car oriented the cities are. Even in Miami which had some walkable areas (e.g. South Beach), the streets feel much less friendly to pedestrians versus a European city.\n\nWhen I stayed in All Star Movies in Disney World, I saw there was a streak restaurant about 15 mins walk away in principle, but there was literally no way you could walk there because of the way the surrounding area is built (e.g. due to having to cross dual carriageways with no pedestrian crossings or no sidewalks).\n\nI did research transportation options and decided Uber would be my primary mode of getting around (e.g. from Disney World accomodation to Kennedy Space Centre, and getting around Miami, and to and from airports). Overall this was fairly cost effective and much less hassle than trying to rent a car when I don't drive at all in London. I'd definitely recommend this for others.\n\nOn getting from Orlando to Miami, there is a train called the Brightline which is in general much better than what most US states. This is a very cost effective way of getting from North to South Florida so again would recommend this (paid about 70 dollars for a ticket, 3.5 hours travel time).  \n\n\n**Weather**\n\nI travelled from late march to early april (after postponing my original trip planned in October 2024) and the weather was great (high 20s Celcius) and not too humid.\n\nI'd definitely recommend planning your Florida trip to avoid the more humid months or hurricane risky months which you can research online.\n\n\n\n**Other Comments:**\n\nAs I said I caught a cold the day before my flight and it wasn't so bad that I felt the need to cancel completely. I powered through but it did still make it tough to enjoy the trip as much, particularly in Miami.\n\nThe flights in particular are brutal with a cold - not only do you feel the normal dehydrating and potential nausea but you can get the painful pressure effect on your ears and forehead due to being congested during ascent and descent. \n\nI recommend having at least 1/3 litre of water to drink before ascent and before descent to ease the congestion as well as the usual decongestants - the water basically gets rid of any potential pain.\n\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nTravelling in the USA is always interesting and different. I've used to London urban planning and have been to Italy/Spain/Greece/France/Thailand/Japan and overall I find it much more comfortable and easy to navigate in the pedestrianised and public transport heavy cities like Rome or Tokyo.\n\nWalking around parts of Miami in particular it just feels sort of soul less some times with the lack of people on the streets as everyone is in cars. Again, just my personal experience.\n\n  \nWould definitely go again to Miami to have a more exciting trip, doing more water activities, hopefully without being congested and jetlagged next time!\n                    Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js95vi/trip_report_8_days_solotravel_in_florida_from_the/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 1\n >>>", name='reddit_search', tool_call_id='call_GyfNX5W6VLr3LaDSFqw18IVo'), AIMessage(content='I found a recent post in r/travel that discusses budget-friendly accommodations as part of a travel report.

Everything is now dictated by political loyalty.\n\n2️⃣ The White House Can Block Agency Budgets or Direct Funds Elsewhere\n\n✅ The OMB can now adjust funding allocations for independent agencies.\n\nThis gives the President the power to defund agencies without needing Congress.\nRegulatory agencies that challenge presidential policies will be quietly strangled of resources.\nAgencies loyal to the President will receive full funding—even illegally.\n🚨 Implication: Congress no longer controls federal spending on regulatory enforcement. The executive branch can choke out opposition agencies and reward allies.\n\n3️⃣ The President & Attorney General Have Final Say on All Legal Interpretations\n✅ All federal employees must follow White House interpretations of the law.\n\nThe Attorney General’s opinions override agency lawyers, inspectors general, and independent counsel.\nAgencies cannot adopt their own interpretations of legal statutes—everything must align with the President’s views.\nThe President can rewrite federal legal interpretations overnight.\n🚨 Implication: Legal consistency is gone. Agencies cannot push back against corrupt, illegal, or unconstitutional directives because the President’s interpretation is the only interpretation allowed.\n\n4️⃣ Installing White House Liaisons in All Regulatory Agencies\n✅ A “White House Liaison” will be placed in every independent agency.\n\nThis ensures constant presidential oversight of daily operations.\nThese liaisons will report agency actions back to the White House and enforce political compliance.\nAgency directors will no longer have the ability to act without White House approval.\n\n🚨 Implication: There is now a direct enforcement arm inside every regulatory body. Even agencies that resist presidential control will be internally monitored and controlled.\n\n📍 Every regulatory body—from financial markets to environmental protections—is now politicized.\n📍 Congress no longer controls federal funding—agencies must obey the White House or risk defunding.\n📍 The President’s legal interpretations override all agency autonomy, eliminating independent enforcement of federal laws.\n📍 The federal bureaucracy, once designed to be resistant to corruption, is now completely subject to presidential loyalty.\n                    Post URL: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 113468\n\nPost Title: \'Climate change is an issue, Mr Clarkson\'\n                    User: Lord_Answer_me_Why\n                    Subreddit: r/clevercomebacks:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/kak6dam815ed1.jpeg\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 93218\n\nPost Title: \'What could it be??\'\n                    User: Pizzacakecomic\n                    Subreddit: r/comics:\n                    Text body: \n                    Post URL: https://i.redd.it/okou7w6knjtd1.png\n                    Post Category: N/A.\n                    Score: 61606\n\nPost Title: \'Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate\'\n                    User: PoliticsModeratorBot\n                    Subreddit: r/politics:\n                    Text body: AP and other sources are reporting that US Vice President Kamala Harris has selected current Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

Large Language models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks across multiple domains. We suggest using an instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to take on this particular task in light of these developments. We have evaluated the publicly available LLMs under zeroshot setting, and finetuned the best performing Flan-T5 model for this task. On the leaderboard, our system ranked second, with an F1 Score of 0.834 on the official test set.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: AI research ethics is in its infancy: the EU’s AI Act can make it a grown-up\nAuthors: Anaïs Rességuier, Fabienne Ufert\nAbstract: As the artificial intelligence (AI) ethics field is currently working towards its operationalisation, ethics review as carried out by research ethics committees (RECs) constitutes a powerful, but so far underdeveloped, framework to make AI ethics effective in practice at the research level. This article contributes to the elaboration of research ethics frameworks for research projects developing and/or using AI. It highlights that these frameworks are still in their infancy and in need of a structure and criteria to ensure AI research projects advance in a way that respects norms and principles. This article proposes to draw from the European Union’s AI Act currently in development to shape these frameworks. Although, in the current form of the draft (as of August 2023), the obligations of the AI Act do not apply to scientific research, it is most likely that they will still have a strong impact on AI research considering the need to anticipate market placement or to test new tools in real world conditions. This article investigates what the risk-based approach in the AI Act implies for research ethics and highlights some AI Act obligations of particular value to implement for ethics review processes.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: GenAICHI 2023: Generative AI and HCI at CHI 2023\nAuthors: Michael J. Muller, Lydia B. Chilton, Anna Kantosalo, Q. Liao, M. Maher, C. P. Martin, Greg Walsh\nAbstract: This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Guidelines on clinical research evaluation of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology (2023).\nAuthors: Wei-Hua Yang, Yang Xu\nAbstract: With the upsurge of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the medical field, its application in ophthalmology has become a cutting-edge research field.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception.

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Lundberg, Harsha Nori, Hamid Palangi, Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Yi Zhang\nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2018\nTitle: Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\nAuthors: Amina Adadi, M. Berrada\nAbstract: At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.\n >>>", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_lV3ns23Uvl2obYt1OPWZINhV'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_rvVLK2FwZNg6xuuxb3mIUOYk', 'function': {'arguments': '{"published_year":"2023"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 21, 'prompt_tokens': 1047, 'total_tokens': 1068, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b2b0cb2e-67a9-4f0e-ac57-d985eb5c3169-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'published_year': '2023'}, 'id': 'call_rvVLK2FwZNg6xuuxb3mIUOYk', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1047, 'output_tokens': 21, 'total_tokens': 1068, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='<<< Done. >>>', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_rvVLK2FwZNg6xuuxb3mIUOYk'), AIMessage(content='I have obtained details on a recent AI research paper from 2023 titled "Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4" by Sébastien Bubeck and others.

Tay, Liang Wang\nAbstract: Infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens remain a primary contributor to global health burdens. Prompt control and effective prevention of these pathogens are critical for public health and medical diagnostics. Conventional microbial detection methods suffer from high complexity, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity. Therefore, developing rapid and reliable methods for microbial pathogen detection has become imperative. Surface‐enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), as an innovative non‐invasive diagnostic technique, holds significant promise in pathogenic microorganism detection due to its rapid, reliable, and cost‐effective advantages. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental theories of Raman Spectroscopy (RS) with a focus on label‐free SERS strategy, reporting on the latest advancements of SERS technique in detecting bacteria, viruses, and fungi in clinical settings. Furthermore, we emphasize the application of machine learning algorithms in SERS spectral analysis. Finally, challenges faced by SERS application are probed, and the prospective development is discussed.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Latest Algorithms in Machine and Deep Learning Methods to Predict Retention Rates and Dropout in Higher Education: A Literature Review\nAuthors: Andy Prasetyo Utomo, Purwanto Purwanto, Bayu Surarso\nAbstract: External factors, such as global impact, or internal factors, such as educational services or the quality of learning, can affect the Retention rate or Number of Dropouts (DO) of students in higher education. Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception. Here we present an overview of the empirical papers published between 2017 and 2023 that address the unique effects of exercise, plasticity-stimulating activities, and the depriving effect of social isolation on brain plasticity and behavior.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) modifies endothelial Ca2+ signaling\nAuthors: Christian Macarilla, Chung-Sik Choi, M. Taylor\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Preventing or reversing endothelial dysfunction is essential for preserving vascular homeostasis and staving off vascular disease. Previous findings from our lab suggest that maintaining a distinct profile of calcium (Ca2+) signals along the endothelial network is crucial for sustaining normal vascular function and structure, and progressive restriction of dynamic Ca2+ signals under chronic low-flow conditions precedes impaired vasodilation and vascular remodeling. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plays a key role in maintaining brain plasticity and has recently been implicated in cardiovascular health, perhaps through direct action on the endothelial TrkB receptors. The goal of this study was to determine whether BDNF might exert its effects by altering the endothelial Ca2+ signaling profile. METHODS: Using confocal imaging, we assessed endothelial Ca2+ in Cal-520-loaded open mouse carotid arteries. RESULTS: Two concentrations of Both BDNF (2.2M x 10-9 and 2.2M x 10-6) and the selective TrkB agonist LM22A-4 (4.8 x 10-9 and 4.8 x 10-6) increased Ca2+ dynamics beyond baseline; LM22A-4 increased frequency of events while BDNF increased the amplitude of events. TrKB receptor inhibition with the antagonist ANA-12 appeared to reduce TrkB dependent Ca2+ changes. These findings suggest that activation of the TrkB receptor alters Ca2+ dynamics in ex vivo carotid arteries. Future work will aim to elucidate the contribution of internal and external sources of Ca2+ and determine the role of shear stress in BDNF release.

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

Students learning to search MEDLINE are taught that MeSH yields precise results, and that MeSH indexing increases an article\'s findability, reliably describing an article\'s contents. Indexing for MEDLINE was done completely by human indexers until 2011. Since April 2022, all articles are assigned MeSH via automated indexing (AI). Per the NLM, MeSH assigned by AI are determined based on terms in title, abstract, and terms and indexing of \'related records\', with human review and curation of results "as appropriate". As MEDLINE instruction typically starts with teaching learners to identify key elements or concepts in their research question and find appropriate MeSH for them, we sought to explore the following: how well does AI identify key concepts of an article? Are concepts missed more or less when compared to human indexers? Drawing on the PICO framework, are missing concepts more often any particular PICO element? Methods: We reviewed samples of automated and human-indexed records from shortly before April 2022, and some entirely-automated from later, to determine whether their main concepts were adequately represented with MeSH. Working in pairs, our team used a web form to assign key concepts (based on the PICO framework) that, per our experience, would be used to find it and similar articles based on title and abstract. Assigned MeSH were then displayed and analyzed to determine whether they adequately represented the key concepts of each record. Results & Conclusion: As the study is ongoing, results are forthcoming. Potential impacts of Automated Indexing on library instruction and basic searching will be discussed. CP2.

To address the problem of information overload, this report by the Natural Language Learning Group at Bielefeld University focuses on identifying the most popular papers on arXiv, with a specific emphasis on NLP and ML. The objective is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research, aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 lis >>>', name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_yjdSyw98hO6BdDVVSBvF8Bi1'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_ccCXMXo7DsjYwwIxOZhDDoEE', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "ChatGPT listed as author on research papers: many scientists disapprove"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_K3xEUkng88jE4o9Ek6IaYWcW', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "CHLA 2023 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2023 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_iCoSdH6kzLqvEdLxOtqQeBrv', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "INSEAD Insights: September 2023 Research Picks"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_usW7lJTNbjUZlZiiY815XsTh', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_title": "NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 161, 'prompt_tokens': 1061, 'total_tokens': 1222, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f09ba646-f133-4142-8953-10fb70df7b4a-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'ChatGPT listed as author on research papers: many scientists disapprove'}, 'id': 'call_ccCXMXo7DsjYwwIxOZhDDoEE', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'CHLA 2023 CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTED PAPERS / ABSC CONGRÈS 2023 COMMUNICATIONS LIBRES'}, 'id': 'call_K3xEUkng88jE4o9Ek6IaYWcW', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'INSEAD Insights: September 2023 Research Picks'}, 'id': 'call_iCoSdH6kzLqvEdLxOtqQeBrv', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer', 'args': {'paper_title': 'NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?'}, 'id': 'call_usW7lJTNbjUZlZiiY815XsTh', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1061, 'output_tokens': 161, 'total_tokens': 1222, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_ccCXMXo7DsjYwwIxOZhDDoEE'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_K3xEUkng88jE4o9Ek6IaYWcW'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_iCoSdH6kzLqvEdLxOtqQeBrv'), ToolMessage(content='<<< Done. >>>', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_usW7lJTNbjUZlZiiY815XsTh'), AIMessage(content='Here are summaries of the newest AI research papers:\n\n1. **ChatGPT listed as author on research papers: many scientists disapprove**:\n   - The paper discusses the controversial trend of listing ChatGPT as an author on research papers.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

We use a novel dataset, making use of the IPC Green Inventory of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to analyze four broad categories of green energy technologies including alternative energy production technologies, energy conservation technologies, and green transportation. We use these data to look at how patent families and PCT international patent applications have evolved in this field in recent years. We find that energy innovation-related patenting has first expanded exponentially up until 2013, both in terms of the total number of patent families and PCT international patent applications in green energy technologies. Yet this period of accelerated growth in the number of published green energy patents has been followed by a period of deceleration—even a slow decline. Although most green energy technologies have seen a downward trend in the annual number of patents published since 2012, the decline has been most pronounced in nuclear power generation technologies and alternative energy production technologies. The latter notably include renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind energy, and fuel cells. In contrast, patents in energy conservation technologies and green transportation technologies have continued to grow, but at a slower pace.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Forestry products as renewable energy sources\nAuthors: Milorad Danilović, L. Nestorovski\nAbstract: The world's energy needs are growing, and fossil fuel resources are becoming less available, and it is certain that, in some period of time, they will disappear. In order to reduce the dependence on non-renewable energy, renewable energy has been increasingly used since the end of the last century. The most important source of renewable energy is biomass, and wood biomass is the most represented. The myth of cheap and easily available energy disappeared in the 70s of the last century after the great energy crisis. Then, it has become clear that the future could not be built on a single source of energy. The greatest success in the development of techniques and technologies for the utilization of wood biomass was achieved by the Scandinavian countries, which managed to put the traditional forestry sector in the function of biomass production for general use.Today, biomass energy production plays a key role in the strategies of many countries, with the aim of climate change mitigation. At the Paris Climate Conference in December 2015, 196 countries adopted a binding global climate agreement. The governments of the participating countries have agreed to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 °C until 2100, compared to the pre-industrial period. Thanks to the insistence of small island countries that are the first to be hit by climate change, the agreement states that an effort will be made to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C (United Natons, UN 2015). Renewable energy consumption in the XXI century recorded a growth of 38.5%. Wood biomass for energy production is found in various forms (piece of wood, chipboard, pellets, briquettes, etc.), and about 50% of the energy produced from biomass is used in industrial plants, for heating residential and business premises, cooking, etc. A large number of EU countries will achieve the planned renewable energy quotas by 2020, and the tasks are set by 2030. They include a minimum of 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to level in 1990, providing a minimum of 27% of renewable energy and a minimum of 27% improvement in energy efficiency (European Pellet Council 2019).

Mateos-Garcia, Konstantinos Stathoulopoulos\nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?\nAuthors: Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen\nAbstract: The rapid growth of information in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the subfields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), presents a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners to keep pace with the latest developments. To address the problem of information overload, this report by the Natural Language Learning Group at Bielefeld University focuses on identifying the most popular papers on arXiv, with a specific emphasis on NLP and ML. The objective is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research, aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 list (noticing the top paper's focus on LLM related issues and higher number of co-authors) and analyze the citation distributions in our dataset, among others.\n\n\nPublished year: 2024\nTitle: Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research:  >>>", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_fgBRPkXbDDf3O6HLWDou0BWv'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_NagjycaytriqXwfEdOFoGejF', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_authors": "Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen"}', 'name': 'ResearchPaperSummarizer'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'call_bAOhSg9QfrkwMGAFi9kyTu6z', 'function': {'arguments': '{"paper_authors": "Joel Klinger, J.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning. In their review they examine various forms of cellular and circuit plasticity mechanisms and their relationships to gradients. What type of models capture network activity? A review by Bernáez Timón et al. (2023) provides an overview of the diversity of neural network models, including models relying on recent advances in machine learning, and how they contribute to the understanding of brain function at the level of circuit computations. The authors emphasise the importance of equipping network models with biological connectivity and training network models under realistic biological constraints. They argue that incorporating these biologically relevant parameters helps in understanding the mechanisms by which biological neural network functions emerge.

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

This report aims to examine CHP technologies based on renewable energy, seek to increase their efficiency and reduce the unsustainable nature of renewable resources, and then examine the existing articles from an economic and technical perspective. Heat and electricity are generated simultaneously in CHP technology; heat is the limiting factor in this issue. Therefore, it should be installed in a place requiring heat and population density because transmission losses are reduced in this case. Among renewable energy sources used as fuel for CHP power plants, biomass has the largest share, and among fossil fuels, natural gas and coal have the largest share in CHP, respectively. The United States, Russia, and China have the largest shares in renewable power plants, respectively. All the articles reviewed mention the need for heat storage for CHP power plants. If regional heating and cooling using CHP technology are used, biomass consumption can be reduced by 31.4% compared to single heating, and this amount can be used more in value-added sectors.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Paving the way for advancement of renewable energy technologies using deep eutectic solvents: A review\nAuthors: Raiyan Al-Farsi, M.

The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.\n\n\nPublished year: 2022\nTitle: Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nAuthors: Yuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu, Amanda Askell, John Kernion, Andy Jones, A.

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

Luan, R. Adams, Yagang Song, Jia Han, Y. Zou\nAbstract: Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of “giving way” at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. Methods The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38\xa0Hz, 1.3-2\xa0mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. Discussion This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

Smith, A. Klintsova\nAbstract: Brain plasticity, also termed neuroplasticity, refers to the brain’s life-long ability to reorganize itself in response to various changes in the environment, experiences, and learning. The brain is a dynamic organ capable of responding to stimulating or depriving environments, activities, and circumstances from changes in gene expression, release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, to cellular reorganization and reprogrammed functional connectivity. The rate of neuroplastic alteration varies across the lifespan, creating further challenges for understanding and manipulating these processes to benefit motor control, learning, memory, and neural remodeling after injury. Neuroplasticity-related research spans several decades, and hundreds of reviews have been written and published since its inception.

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies’ profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors’ decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study’s results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies’ profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies’ financial policies to support them.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Green taxation and renewable energy technologies adoption: A global evidence\nAuthors: Tii N.

In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 list.'}, 'id': 'call_rZlKdx6kNfu1lYeUaU5JNPAq', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1063, 'output_tokens': 928, 'total_tokens': 1991, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_wX668WO6yW6TYn9BJWS9tngs'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_cJS8rA7kAsj6sKMoWPZaM9Ls'), ToolMessage(content='Done.', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_f6M1H1mEdYma6qcP6Y8YVaml'), ToolMessage(content='<<< Done. >>>', name='ResearchPaperSummarizer', tool_call_id='call_rZlKdx6kNfu1lYeUaU5JNPAq'), AIMessage(content='Here are summaries of the newest AI research papers:\n\n1. **ChatGPT listed as author on research papers: many scientists disapprove**:\n   - No abstract provided, but this paper likely discusses the controversy surrounding the attribution of AI models, such as ChatGPT, as authors of research papers.

Tóth, Michael Okun\nAbstract: The theory of the action potential was formulated byHodgkin andHuxley 70 years ago. Five landmark papers summarizing their experimental data and quantitative model were published in The Journal of Physiology in 1952 providing the first description of action potential generation. This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al.

Mateos-Garcia, Konstantinos Stathoulopoulos\nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?\nAuthors: Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen\nAbstract: The rapid growth of information in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the subfields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), presents a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners to keep pace with the latest developments. To address the problem of information overload, this report by the Natural Language Learning Group at Bielefeld University focuses on identifying the most popular papers on arXiv, with a specific emphasis on NLP and ML. The objective is to offer a quick guide to the most relevant and widely discussed research, aiding both newcomers and established researchers in staying abreast of current trends. In particular, we compile a list of the 40 most popular papers based on normalized citation counts from the first half of 2023. We observe the dominance of papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically ChatGPT during the first half of 2023, with the latter showing signs of declining popularity more recently, however. Further, NLP related papers are the most influential (around 60\\% of top papers) even though there are twice as many ML related papers in our data. Core issues investigated in the most heavily cited papers are: LLM efficiency, evaluation techniques, ethical considerations, embodied agents, and problem-solving with LLMs. Additionally, we examine the characteristics of top papers in comparison to others outside the top-40 list (noticing the top paper's focus on LLM related issues and higher number of co-authors) and analyze the citation distributions in our dataset, among others.\n\n\nPublished year: 2024\nTitle: Navigating the AI frontiers in cardiovascular research:  >>>", name='semanticscholar', tool_call_id='call_NsVtcF6ozqw5Bzdkzqo8DU68'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_Zjs9DvlgeX3ZZQNUmiGxVvgX', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input": "A narrowing of AI research?

Higher education institutions must have a strategy to manage retention rates properly. They can take an initial approach by knowing the estimated retention rate or the number of DOs so they can anticipate it by determining the right strategy. Several researchers have researched retention prediction or DO using specific methods and algorithms. This literature review aims to provide an overview and analysis of the methods and algorithms used to predict retention rates or the Number of DOs of students in higher education and to know the latest trends in developing the algorithms used in predicting retention rates or DO. The method used in this research is the traditional literature review. We have identified Twenty-one articles according to the theme. From the article, there are 21 machine learning algorithms, 13 deep learning algorithms used, seven time-series algorithms, four feature selection algorithms, and three combinations of algorithms used. The review results show that deep learning algorithms provide higher accuracy values than machine learning algorithms, and the recent trend of using algorithms to predict retention levels or DO is towards using time series algorithms in deep learning methods.\n\n\nPublished year: 2023\nTitle: Trends in Machine Learning and Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review for Undergraduate Researchers\nAuthors: Nathaniel Murungi, Michael Vinh Pham, Xu-feng Dai, Xiaodong Qu\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the context of Machine Learning.

This is one of the first examples of a close collaboration between mathematics and neuroscience that played a key role in laying the foundation of modern computational neuroscience. In recent decades computational neuroscience has become recognised as a prominent and independent subdiscipline of neuroscience. Existing computational approaches are used to advance our knowledge across all scales relevant to the neuroscience endeavour: from nanometre-sized sub-cellular structures to brain-wide neuroimaging studies and quantification of organismal behaviour. Moreover, experimental data, pouring onto the storage devices of our computers at an exponentially increasing rate, inspire the development of new cutting-edge computational approaches. Collaborative efforts between computational, theoretical and experimental neuroscientists play an increasingly important role in the deeper understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this special issue of The Journal of Physiology on Computational Neuroscience, we aim to give a broad overview of the diverse avenues of research utilising computational approaches to better understand the basic principles of neuronal communication, how the brain processes, stores and retrieves information. The invited reviews in this issue address numerous aspects of computational approaches in neuroscience research. How did the Hodgkin–Huxley model influence neuroscience since its publication in 1952? Its impact on research into single cell computation mechanisms continues to grow to this day. These efforts are not restricted to neuroscience. Since 1960 the model has been extended to cardiac muscle cells, and the impact of the model on modern physiology in general is discussed in this issue by Noble (2022). The relationship between current neuronal models and the Hodgkin–Huxley model is detailed in two reviews. The first, by Petousakis et al. (2023), discusses recent studies in which this biophysical modelling was relied upon to unveil principles of dendritic information processing spanning from non-linear dendritic integration to the contribution of backpropagating action potentials and synaptic plasticity to single neuron computation. The second, by Haufler et al. (2023), reviews the legacy of the Hodgkin–Huxley model in the field of neocortical network modelling. The authors discuss how the extension of the model’s framework through single-neuron and small-network modelling enabled the evolution of cortical network modelling. How do various plastic changes combine to improve behavioural outcomes? Richards & Kording (2023) explore the utility of gradient descent to better understand how small changes occurring in the forms of synaptic plasticity lead to improved performance during learning.

The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.\nComputer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.\nARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. The ARPANET expanded rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.\nSeveral early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data networking. Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann pioneered a simplified end-to-end approach to internetworking at the IRIA. Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London in 1973. Bob Metcalfe developed the theory behind Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet. ARPA initiatives and the International Network Working Group developed and refined ideas for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks. Vint Cerf, now at Stanford University, and Bob Kahn, now at DARPA, published their research on internetworking in 1974. Through the Internet Experiment Note series and later RFCs this evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), two protocols of the Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. The development of packet switching networks was underpinned by mathematical work in the 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.\n\nIn the late 1970s, national and international public data networks emerged based on the X.25 protocol, designed by Rémi Després and others. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP on existing networks in the United States and around the world marked the beginnings of the Internet. Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia. Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990. The optical backbone of the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic, as traffic transitioned to optical networks managed by Sp >>>', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_0RkwFCPP8cw0ssOEOl9qKdMK'), AIMessage(content="The history of the Internet began with scientists and engineers working to interconnect computer networks.

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\nTesla is one of the world\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the "Tesla Takedown" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\n\n\n\nPage: History of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company is named after Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla is the world\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and, as of the end of 2021, Tesla\'s cumulative global vehicle sales totaled 2.3 million units.\n\n\n\nPage: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. has been criticized for its cars, workplace culture, business practices, and occupational safety. Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.\n\nPage: A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China\nSummary: A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China: An Investigative History (1999) is a history of international relations written by journalist Patrick Tyler.

They sparked the "Beatlemania" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society\'s developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era\'s youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music\'s evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers\' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists\' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were "more popular than Jesus now".\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era\'s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".\nOver the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of "Yesterday" reaching 1,600 by 1986. As of 2009, they were the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends.

It took place near the present-day town of Battle in East Sussex, around 7 miles northwest of Hastings.\n\nThe battle's roots lay in a succession crisis that followed the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066.

Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high turnover rate. Employees have reported poor treatment and policies, resulting in a high injury rate, with some having faced sexual harassment, racism, and union-busting incidents. Tesla\'s environmental practices, use of cryptocurrencies, and compliance with open source licenses have been mentioned by critics. Detractors also claim that Tesla and Musk\'s public relations activities have been used to deflect criticisms.\nMusk and his company have been repeatedly accused of engaging in fraud, such as in their buyout of SolarCity, selling defective vehicles, overpromising, and posting reckless tweets. One tweet resulted in Musk agreeing to pay a fine and step down as Tesla\'s chairman. Proponents and opponents of Tesla consistently accuse each other of conflict of interests, believing Tesla\'s stock valuation is either under- or over-valued.\n\n\n\nPage: Tesla Model 3\nSummary: The Tesla Model 3 is a battery electric powered mid-size sedan with a fastback body style built by Tesla, Inc., introduced in 2017.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\nPage: History of the Great Wall of China\nSummary: The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC) and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts.

These walls were later connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to safeguard the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) from Inner Asian nomadic incursions.\n\n2. **Expansion by Dynasties**: \n   - The **Han dynasty** (202 BC – 220 AD) extended the fortifications further west.\n   - The **Northern Qi** (550–574) added about 1,600 kilometers (990 mi) of new walls.\n   - The **Ming dynasty** (1368–1644) is known for building the most well-preserved sections, using stone and brick, often through difficult terrain.\n\n3. **Other Dynasties**: While some dynasties like the **Tang** (618–907), **Song** (960–1279), **Yuan** (1271–1368), and **Qing** (1644–1912) did not prioritize wall-building, opting for military and diplomatic measures instead, the Great Wall remained a significant line of defense.\n\n### Structure and Features:\n- It includes watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, and signaling capabilities using smoke or fire.\n- The wall also served as border control, regulating immigration, emigration, and trade duties, especially along the Silk Road.\n\n### Legacy and Significance:\n- Spanning 21,196.18 kilometers (13,170.70 miles) from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, it delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe.\n- The Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007.\n- It stands today as a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination, representing enduring historical significance and architectural prowess. \n\nDespite its formidable structure, the Wall did not always succeed in preventing invasions, as seen in 1644 when the Qing troops penetrated its defenses and took over from the Ming dynasty.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne.

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority ove >>>", name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_EQW0FlG2cScpcf54K9Jr8QAE'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_4XPWo7h9ykJTQUrjsNymmzwS', 'function': {'arguments': '{"wikipedia_output":"The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman Conquest of England.

This, coupled with the adoption of TCP/IP globally and the emergence of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the late 1980s, marked the beginnings of the modern Internet.\n\nThe transition to commercial use was completed by 1995 when the NSFNET backbone was decommissioned, although it faced regulatory challenges and concerns about data privacy and security.\n\nIf you'd like this information as an email draft, let me know!", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 401, 'prompt_tokens': 2772, 'total_tokens': 3173, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1792}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-91feb9e6-57b9-47b3-8e8a-5dad6f112bde-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2772, 'output_tokens': 401, 'total_tokens': 3173, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1792}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]

Introduced as a concept vehicle in November 2019, its body design is reminiscent of low-polygon modeling, consisting of flat stainless steel sheet panels.\nTesla initially planned to produce the vehicle in late 2021, but after many delays, it entered production in November 2023 and was first delivered to customers later that month. Two models are currently offered: a trimotor all-wheel drive (AWD) model called Cyberbeast, and a dual-motor AWD model. A single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) model is slated to be available in 2025. EPA range estimates cover 250–340 miles (400–550 km), varying by model. The Cybertruck is only sold in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\nPage: Tesla Autopilot\nSummary: Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides "Base Autopilot" on all vehicles, which includes Autosteer, and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot.\nThe company\'s stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal. The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not "fully self-driving" and require active driver supervision.\nThe company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving. Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies. Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla\'s decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.\nSince 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years, most recently predicting the end of 2023.\nIn February 2025, Tesla Autopilot was considered defective for normal use, by a German court, due to phantom braking issues.\n\nPage: Tesla Roadster (first generation)\nSummary: The first generation Tesla Roadster is a battery electric sports car, that is based on the Lotus Elise chassis, and was produced by Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway legal, serial production, all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 244 miles (393 km) per charge. It is also the first production car to be launched into deep space, carried by a Falcon Heavy rocket in a test flight on February 6, 2018.\nTesla sold about 2,450 Roadsters in over 30 countries, and most of the last Roadsters were sold in Europe and Asia during the fourth quarter of 2012. Tesla produced right-hand-drive Roadsters from early 2010. The Roadster qualified for government incentives in several nations.\nAccording to the U.S. EPA, the Roadster can travel 244 miles (393 km) on a single charge of its lithium-ion battery pack. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 3.7 or 3.9 seconds depending on the model. It has a top speed of 125 mph (201 km/h). The Roadster\'s efficiency, as of September 2008, was reported as 120 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (28 kW⋅h/100 mi) (2.0 L/100 km). It uses 21.7 kWh/100 mi (135 Wh/km) battery-to-wheel, and has an efficiency of 88% on average. >>>', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_AKChkWFISFjRZ396Qi0v7hX0'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_kMdj5cSFvLtHumamLO9CgMs5', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"Tesla, Inc."}', 'name': 'wikipedia'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 17, 'prompt_tokens': 1144, 'total_tokens': 1161, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-bf7c48fd-b8df-4c8c-8530-8e72d2f07f82-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'wikipedia', 'args': {'query': 'Tesla, Inc.'}, 'id': 'call_kMdj5cSFvLtHumamLO9CgMs5', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1144, 'output_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 1161, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='<<< Page: Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc.

Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\'s first funding round and became the company\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\nTesla is one of the world\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the "Tesla Takedown" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\n\n\n\nPage: History of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.

Tesla is the world\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and, as of the end of 2021, Tesla\'s cumulative global vehicle sales totaled 2.3 million units.\n\n\n\nPage: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. has been criticized for its cars, workplace culture, business practices, and occupational safety. Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and "whompy wheels" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticized the company\'s "stealth" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high >>>', name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_kMdj5cSFvLtHumamLO9CgMs5'), AIMessage(content="Tesla, Inc., an American multinational automotive and clean energy company, was founded in July 2003 by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.

The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin\'s routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time.

They sparked the "Beatlemania" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society\'s developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era\'s youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music\'s evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers\' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists\' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were "more popular than Jesus now".\nThe Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era\'s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".\nOver the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of "Yesterday" reaching 1,600 by 1986.

It took place approximately 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\n\n\n\nPage: William the Conqueror\nSummary: William the Conqueror (c.\u20091028 – 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority ove >>>", name='wikipedia', tool_call_id='call_dOhrSrMPj67G9TgKpEsxaZXe'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_09vwZxmPfgDyFIdNZAgVPcPg', 'function': {'arguments': '{"tool_input":"The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson."}', 'name': 'WikipediaSummaryValidator'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 58, 'prompt_tokens': 1122, 'total_tokens': 1180, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6dd05565ef', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-ef1cd2d2-6d89-400d-9781-818f5a7667e9-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'WikipediaSummaryValidator', 'args': {'tool_input': 'The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson.'}, 'id': 'call_09vwZxmPfgDyFIdNZAgVPcPg', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1122, 'output_tokens': 58, 'total_tokens': 1180, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='<<< The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson.
